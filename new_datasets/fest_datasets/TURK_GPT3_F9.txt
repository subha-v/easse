Hello, everyone.
Congrats ADA 30!
You did a great job with the event.
Thank you Corey and Elizabeth for the invitation.
It's almost November, let's go vote!
Your choices and voices are important.
Everyone should share their opinion in November.
Find out where to vote.
Absentee ballots are an option, and there may be other choices too.
We all should have equal rights, regardless of our size or background.
Remember to vote in November.
Would you notice me if I stayed quiet?
This course is a review.
Do we all travel in different cars?
Cars, trucks, bikes, wheelchairs, motorized wheelchairs, canes, and crutches.
Watch out, and help us get to where we need to go.
This is a special moment.
4 Wheel City is thankful.
This is 4 Wheel City.
Thank you for joining us tonight.
My name is Gha'il Rhodes Benjamin, I reminded you before.
I support disabled people.
We all share the same air.
We have more in common than we think, like Maya Angelou said.
Have a great summer!
Be careful.
We care about you.
Thank you for joining us.
We'll see each other soon.
Welcome to the Disability Unite Festival!
My name is Gha'il Benjamin.
I'm glad to be here with you tonight.
We have been waiting for this moment.
The moment is called "It Just Had to be Said".
We are all redefining our identities, in protest of 2020.
These artists will tell you the truth.
Now I can tell you about me.
My name is Gha'il Rhodes Benjamin, I'm a performance spoken-word artist.
I wrote and performed this piece, it is called Global Libations.
We remember the heroes and sheroes who are no longer with us, leaving behind families and friends.
Global Drinks.
Zazel O'Garra is the founder and leader of ZCO Dance Project and is very powerful.
She has a lot of influence in the art world.
She is unstoppable.
Zazel is unstoppable.
She is amazing.
Her dancers are amazing.
They travel easily through space and time.
They never give up.
They work hard and never give up.
Come watch "We the People", a piece choreographed by Wendy Powell, to see what I mean.
Raise your hands.
Prepare yourself.
Now, watch the ZCO Dance Project.
Cheer for ZCO!
Hello, Andrea.
Welcome to the Disability Night event.
Thank you for joining us today.
We're so happy you are here.
People call you the seated nurse.
Can you tell us a bit about yourself and your disability?
I'm the nurse sitting here.
I'm the first registered nurse who is a wheelchair user in New York City. I have transverse myelitis too.
I got sick at 5 and couldn't walk at 12.
Amazing!
You are very special and talented.
We've been friends for a while.
You were Miss Wheelchair New York.
Why did you decide to be a nurse?
I didn't always plan to be a nurse.
We talked about how important representation is, right?
I couldn't find any nurses with disabilities that looked like me.
I wanted to be a doctor.
I wanted to be a lawyer before that.
I wanted to help others, so I can reach my goals.
In medical school, you learn how diseases affect the body.
I wanted to treat people with respect.
I wanted to help people, so nursing was the perfect job for me.
As a nurse in a wheelchair, do you think it helps you relate to patients?
Yes, totally.
When you are in a wheelchair or have any kind of disability, you can share a different point of view.
Disability is not the same as death.
Nursing with a disability shows others that life goes on even outside the hospital.
You are giving people hope and new opportunities, even when doctors and nurses don't have disabilities.
This is a different way of looking at things.
We can create new things, so that's a good thing.
We can plan ahead for the future.
Yes, exactly.
You helped during the COVID-19 crisis.
Can you tell us about that and your experiences?
COVID had a big impact in New York.
We will be dealing with the effects of this for a long time.
They say this is the new normal, right?
We don't want to stay inside.
We don't want our loved ones getting sick from COVID.
People with disabilities often stay home, are afraid to go to hospitals or clinics and understand this difficult life.
We can adjust to it better than other people.
Now we can help others understand what it's like.
Tell us your stories.
Let's help each other get through this difficult time.
Yes, that's right.
What advice can you give during this pandemic?
Many people have been away from their usual routines because of isolation.
What advice can you give to stay healthy?
Stay away from big crowds right now.
Remember to wash your hands.
Remember to go to your appointments.
Don't avoid going to clinics and hospitals, it can harm your health.
Keep going to the doctor and get the treatments you need.
Let's stay healthy.
We need to talk to our doctors to make it happen.
As a nurse, I can tell you that precautions are being taken to keep us safe when entering buildings.
Take care of yourselves.
Go outside.
Call a friend for help.
You are not alone in this.
Yes.
What advice do you have for someone wanting to be a nurse or work in health care?
It was not easy for you to be accepted into that community.
It was a tough challenge.
We need to remember that disability does not mean someone can't do something.
I am still able to help you, even though I am sitting down.
We sometimes put down ourselves and think we can't do something because it's for people without disabilities.
What can you do to help?
We do things in our own way.
We can be creative and find solutions no matter what abilities we have, like hearing or vision impairments, or using crutches or needing to sit or lift.
Sometimes you need help, and sometimes you can do it alone.
Remember, other people's opinions of us don't matter.
Choose how to join this field, and create your story.
You get to decide that.
That's wonderful.
Where do you think Andrea will be in 10 years?
I'm studying for a master's in nursing education. In the next couple of years, I want to get a doctorate in nursing practice.
I want to help our community.
It's important that health care workers understand disabilities and how to treat them.
Treat and understand.
That's wonderful.
Thank you, Andrea Dalzell, for joining us today at Disability Unite.
You help our community make progress, thank you. We are inspired by you.
Thanks for joining us. Good luck and we'll be watching your progress.
Thanks, Corey.
Thanks everyone.
Be safe.
Goodbye.

Hi, I'm Jeff Tweedy. I'm introducing Gaelynn Lea, the next performer.
We met a few years ago at a festival in Montana.
Meeting Gaelynn felt like we had known each other forever, like family.
She's performed with Wilco.
She won a concert in 2016 and then toured with her husband.
She does a show on YouTube every Sunday, and has performed in 45 states and 9 countries.
She works hard to make the world better.
I really care about her.
I'm excited for you to watch her perform.
Hi, everyone!
My name is Justin Cooper, and I help organize the Chicago Disability Pride Parade.
I'm proud to be part of this virtual festival.
Usually during Disability Pride Month, we show our pride with parades and events.
COVID changed how we share events, so we needed a new plan.
In Chicago, we made a video with members of our group, talking about how the disability pride parade and 30th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act affects them.
At one of our meetings, Disability Unite members joined us to talk about the video process.
We talked about our parade plans and their festival plans.
We thought about how we could work together to help our disability communities.
I wanted to work with disability groups around the USA, not just Chicago and New York.
People with disabilities are proud to stand together and support each other during the pandemic.
We've always looked out for each other, providing what we need to live and be part of the community.
We should love, fight, and support each other.
Let's organize disability pride parades and festivals to create awareness and keep it going for years.
Thank you for this opportunity.
I'm thankful to Matt and Elizabeth Axel for connecting with the Chicago Disability Pride Parade Committee and Disability Unite.
The committee looks forward to working with you soon.
Thank you for giving me this opportunity.
I hope this is a great festival today.
Let's celebrate disability pride.
Thank you so much.
Hello everyone.
Hi, this is Lachi.
Let's celebrate how amazing we all are!
The disability community is interconnected.
I can do many things, not just act, sing and write.
I'm a black and blind woman, and I am beautiful.
We are all different.
We're creative and loving.
We have been recognized for 30 years, and here's to 30 more years.
I'm Laura Benanti, I'm honored to introduce Evan Ruggiero.
Evan is from New Jersey, and I'm proud of it!
He was 5 when he started tapping, then he was diagnosed with cancer in college.
He had nine surgeries in six months and made the hard choice to amputate his leg.
After 18 months and two days, he was able to tap dance with his new peg leg.
He is very brave and inspiring.
He is amazing, he has performed for Ellen DeGeneres, the Bidens, and even the Oscars.
That's amazing!
He's a nominee for the Drama Desk and Chita Rivera Dance Awards.
He is amazing.
He is a kind person, and that helps a lot.
Thank you for inviting me, now here he is.
Hi, I'm Thomas Ellenson. I'm happy to introduce Ryan Niemiller, who is funny and a leader for disabled actors and comics.
I wrote my own material so people would give me a chance and hire me.
But I don't think I'm a disabled actor or comedian, like Ryan.
Disability is part of my life.
My humor doesn't just come from one place.
Laughter helped Ryan a lot when he was younger.
Kids can be mean when you are different from them.
Use humor to fight back against bullies.
Ryan is known as the Cripple Threat, he uses humor to make a difference.
Ryan said that laughter can bring everyone together and make life happy, including mine.
I am excited to introduce Cripple Threat Ryan Niemiller from America's Got Talent.
Thank you!
Hi, everyone!
I'm Victor Calise, I work for the Mayor's Office for People With Disabilities.
Welcome to the Disability Unite Festival!
We have an awesome program of music, dance, art, discussion, gaming, and more.
Thank you to the Mayor's Office for People With Disabilities and Access For All for making this event happen.
We worked with our partners to create a great celebration in a hard time.
Our country is facing hard times.
I saw our community work hard to succeed.
Working together, we become strong and succeed.
Today is the 30th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act. This law says that everyone must have the same rights and opportunities.
We are celebrating 50 years of Disabled in Action, a civil rights group from New York City.
We thank the DIA leaders who worked hard to get us the disability rights we have now.
We support all civil rights movements, including communities of color and LGBTQ.
We owe thanks to civil rights movements, and should keep supporting them to make the disability rights movement stronger.
ADA helped us make progress in disability rights.
July is a time for celebration, but we must still fight for our rights.
The Disability Unite Festival is a great way to show how amazing and unique our community is.
This platform helps us become more equal and inclusive.
We can still be a community even when we’re apart.
We all have community inside us.
We show love for ourselves and others through our words, actions, and advocacy.
Together, we are strong.
We can make change, we have made progress for disability rights, and we will keep fighting until everyone has the same access and opportunity.
Have fun at the festival, and let's meet up again next year.
Celebrate Disability Pride Month!
We are showing music from many kinds of artists, from beginners to experts.
The ADA is important for our work.
Disabled people can make art too.
It makes sure we can do this.
That's why there are lots of artists and arts groups now.
We need more than the ADA.
Disability artistry helps us think of access in a different way, not just as rules, but as something we can do.
Our future starts now.
Hello, I'm Miranda Hoffner.
I help make the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts accessible for everyone.
I'm happy to show you two pieces from our ADA in the Arts series.
Heidi Latsky Dance is the first partner we've worked with at Lincoln Center.
We admire her work.
This is a piece called SOLO FLIGHT ADA 30.
15 artists, both disabled and not disabled, shared their experience of being alone.
Have fun!
This video is part of Lincoln Center's ADA in the Arts Series.
Queens Theater and Queens Theater for All Initiative are working together.
Disabled artists wrote, performed and directed a virtual reading of the play "Death Bites" by Makena Metz.
We hope you like it.
Hello, I'm Rebecca Cokely. I'm the director of the Disability Justice Initiative at the Center for American Progress.
Jackson Santi is a poet and artist from Chicago starting his career.
His poem shows he has a bright future.
Jackson Santi is here with his song, "Photosynthesis and Other Life Lessons".
Hi, I'm Ricky McKinnie, with the Blind Boys of Alabama. We love to sing together.
Welcome to the Disability Unite Festival, we are here to celebrate us!
The Disability Unite Festival was created to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act.
Project Access for All is a group of people and organizations that work together.
The festival is for our community, made by our community.
Victor Calise, the leader of New York City, just spoke. We thank him for this.
His team is amazing.
Jonathan Novick hosts weekly phone calls to help New York City get through the coronavirus pandemic.
The disability community got to know each other better and worked together.
The Mayor's Offices for People With Disabilities in each city help each other during hard times.
This crisis has a good result.
Disability groups from everywhere are joining together and growing as a community.
This year, we celebrate both the 30th anniversary of the ADA and the 50th anniversary of Disabled in Action.
We are very honored to have Jean Ryan, president of Disability Unite, here to start the festival.
DIA, or Disabled in Action, fights for equal rights for people with all kinds of disabilities.
Jean, do you want to say something?
Thank you very much.
We have worked hard for 50 years, with meetings, emails, lawsuits, sit-ins, and arrests.
You talked about Commissioner Calise's role in our community, Matt.
I want to talk about his appointment to the MTA Board.
Commissioner Calise was appointed with the help of the community.
We must make sure we have a seat at the table, and find people like Commissioner Calise to lead us forward.
I am happy about Disability Unite.
Many disabled people and allies support DIA, making us strong.
I agree, Jean.
We can make changes together.
We hope you enjoy the Disability Unite Festival and join us in making our communities equal for everyone.

Gender equality is everybody's issue.
We need it for our society and economy.
Hiring people with disabilities is about more than just fairness. It can also help a company become more successful.
We must make gender equality happen now, not wait 100 years for equal power and 257 years for equal pay.
We must fight for equality, access, and inclusion for all.
We will work for fairness for people with disabilities, people of color, and LGBTQ people.
The Female Quotient helps organizations create change and get results.
We are making the workplace and media better through solutions, measurements, and helping companies.
We help business leaders create equality and publish a book with tips on how to make change.
We are excited to work with Disability Unite and the disability community.
