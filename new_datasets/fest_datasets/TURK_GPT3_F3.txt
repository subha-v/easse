Hey everyone!
Andy Arias is an actor and an advocate.
Celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act!
I'd like to recognize disabilityunite.org for their work.
We appreciate your hard work in organizing this fantastic event.
Corey and Elizabeth invited me to do this.
It's almost November! That means it's time to exercise your right to vote. Don't forget to go out and cast your ballot!
Your decisions and opinions are important now more than ever.
No matter which political side you are on, make sure you vote in November.
Know the location of your polling place.
If you are unable to vote in person, you may be able to request an absentee ballot or find another voting option.
It is time for us all to be equal in what we say and in our decisions. We are the biggest group in the world, no matter our race, gender, or other backgrounds.
Remember to go to the polls in November and cast your vote.
Did you want me to tell you something?
4 Wheel City is offering an event called The Movement, designed to help people with cognitive disabilities like autism, aphasia, and ADHD.
This course is designed to help you review topics you already know.
We each have our own car/vehicle?
Types of transportation: cars, trucks, bicycles, wheelchairs, motorized wheelchairs, canes, crutches.
Be kind and considerate when helping people with cognitive disabilities reach their destination.
This is an unusual situation, and it may be hard to comprehend.
Thanks to everyone from 4 Wheel City for your support!

We really appreciate you joining us this evening.
I am Gha'il Rhodes Benjamin.
I support people with disabilities, such as autism, aphasia, and ADHD.
We share the same air.
We all occupy the same area.
We have lots in common, just like Maya Angelou said.
Enjoy your summer!
Follow safety protocols to protect yourself.
We care about you.
We appreciate you being here.
Goodbye until we meet again.
Welcome to the Disability Unite Festival! We are happy to have you here.
Hi, my name is Gha'il.
I'm glad to be here with you tonight.
We have been eagerly awaiting this moment.
This moment is important and needs to be heard.
We are all artists in this next segment, speaking out in protest of 2020. We are united in our fear, outrage, and defiance, and we are all redefining who we are.
These next few artists will give you an honest message.
I want to share some information about me.
Hi, my name is Gha'il Rhodes Benjamin. I am a performance spoken-word artist.
This song is called Global Libations and I wrote and performed it.
This memorial honors those who have passed away, the heroes and heroines who are no longer with us. They may have left behind spouses, children, grandparents, and elders.
Global Drinks: International Beverages for Everyone
Zazel O'Garra is an impressive leader. She is the founder and artistic director of ZCO Dance Project.
She is a leader in art.
No matter what, she will keep going forward.
No matter what, Zazel will remain strong.
She has amazing energy.
Her dancers are incredible, able to move in ways that seem to go against the laws of gravity.
They move easily through different places and times.
They seem to be unable to pause or take a break.
Their hard work and dedication surpass all expectations.
Come watch a performance of "We the People" by Wendy Powell. See what I'm talking about!
Raise your arms.
Be prepared.
The ZCO Dance Project is happening now.
Go, ZCO!
It's nice to meet you.Hi Andrea, Nice to meet you.
Welcome to the Disability Night platform! We are here to provide support and resources for those living with autism, aphasia, and ADHD.
Thank you for joining us.
We are delighted that you are here.
You help people while sitting down.
Please tell us a bit about yourself and your disability.
Yes, I am the nurse who is sitting.
I am the first registered nurse in New York City who uses a wheelchair and has transverse myelitis. I recently graduated from nursing school.
When I was five years old, I was diagnosed with an issue that caused me to stop walking when I was 12.
That was a really difficult problem you just solved.Well done! You solved a tough problem.
You have special abilities.
We have been friends for a while.
You won a title for being in a wheelchair: Miss Wheelchair New York.
Why do you want to be a nurse?
I didn't always plan to be a nurse.
We talked about representation a while ago. Do you remember what it meant to us?
I didn't see nurses like me who have a disability, regardless of my gender or ethnicity.
I aspire to become a doctor.
I originally planned to become a lawyer.
I wanted to help others by giving back.
Medical school teaches you how to treat diseases and how they affect a person's body.
I didn't want to treat someone as if they were ill.
I wanted to care for them and make them feel valued, so nursing was the perfect choice.
As a nurse in a chair, did you find any benefits in being able to relate to people when you interact with them in the patient setting?
Iâ€™m so happy for you!Congratulations!
No matter how you are seated or any disability you may have, you offer a unique perspective that others may not have.
People with disabilities may be incorrectly seen as having their lives limited, but this is not true.
No matter your disability, you can still be a nurse and help others in the hospital or clinic.
You're offering them a fresh start and renewed hope, which may not come from someone without a disability.
It's a unique viewpoint.
We are creative thinkers and have a great advantage.
We can anticipate what may happen in the future.
Simply, yes.
You helped during the COVID-19 crisis.
Can you share some information about that and your personal experiences?
COVID really impacted New York, it was like a tornado had swept through.
The number of people who have died, the number of people who are ill, and the number of people who are getting better, will continue to change over time.
This is the new way of life that we are now living.
I don't want this.
We want to be free.
We want our loved ones to stay healthy and avoid the health problems caused by COVID.
We know what it is like to have our lives disrupted by our disabilities. We understand the fear of exclusion and the fear of going to hospitals and clinics.
We can adjust better than most people.
We understand what it's like to face these challenges.
Tell us about something that happened to you.
We can get through this together.
Exactly.
Stay safe during the pandemic by following the guidelines set by local health officials. Practice social distancing, wash your hands regularly, and wear a face covering when out in public.
Because many people have been forced to stay apart from their usual activities.
Advice to maintain a healthy lifestyle: Eat a balanced diet with plenty of fruits and vegetables. Exercise regularly. Get plenty of sleep. Limit alcohol and caffeine intake. Take time to relax and destress.
Limit your visits to large gatherings.
Wear a mask when outside.
Wash your hands.
Remember to keep up with your appointments.
It is important to not avoid medical care. Going to clinics and hospitals can help keep you healthy.
Go to your doctor regularly and follow your treatment plan.
We want to stay healthy.
In order to do that, we need to talk to our doctors.
As a nurse with experience in COVID, I can assure you that extra steps are being taken to keep everyone safe when entering buildings.
Be sure to take care of yourself.
Go outside and have fun.
Reach out to someone you know.
You are not alone.
Yes, absolutely.
Advice for someone interested in a career in health care: Research the different health care roles to find the one that is right for you. Speak with people already working in the health care industry to learn more and get advice. Develop a plan of action to gain the skills you need to enter the field.
It was difficult for you to be accepted into this community.
It was difficult.
This job requires understanding that people with disabilities can still succeed. Is that correct?
I can help you even though I'm sitting down.
We should not limit ourselves because of our abilities. Everyone can achieve great things regardless of their physical or cognitive abilities.
How can you accomplish this?
We all have unique ways of doing things.
We can work together to find solutions that accommodate everyone's needs, no matter what your physical or cognitive abilities are.
If you need help, don't be afraid to ask. But try to do things on your own first.
No matter what other people think of us, it does not change who we are.
You have the choice to start in this field and decide what your story will be.
Only you can decide that.
That looks great.
In 10 years, where do you think Andrea will be?
I am studying a master's in nursing education and I plan to get a doctorate of nursing practice in a few years.
I want to help our community.
It is very important for health care workers to understand people with disabilities, their needs, and how to care for them.
Treat and understand.
That looks great.
Thank you, Andrea, for joining us today on Disability Unite. We appreciate your time.
You are a leader, a teacher, and an inspiration.
Thank you for your hard work and dedication to our community. Your actions are inspiring and appreciated.
We appreciate you joining us. We hope you have success and we will keep an eye on your progress.
Thank you, Corey.
We appreciate your efforts.
Be safe.
Goodbye! Have a nice day.

Hello everyone, I'm Jeff Tweedy from Wilco. I'm here to introduce Gaelynn Lea, the next performer.
We met a few years ago at a festival in Montana.
Gaelynn was someone you could feel an instant connection with, like you had been friends or family for a long time.
Wilco has a new opening act: She.
She won a special show in 2016 and then went on tour with her husband.
She has performed in 45 states and 9 countries, and now streams a show on YouTube every Sunday.
She has an endless supply of enthusiasm to improve the world.
I have strong feelings for her.
I am excited for you to watch her performance.
Hi everyone!
I'm Justin Cooper and I'm on the Chicago Disability Pride Parade Committee.
We are delighted to join this amazing online event.
I'm grateful to Disability Unite for letting me talk to you.
During Disability Pride Month, people with disabilities celebrate and show pride in their identities through parades and other events in many locations.
Due to COVID, we have had to adjust the way we present our events.
In Chicago, we created a video with members of our committee to share their thoughts about the disability pride parade and the 30th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act. We wanted to know how this event and anniversary affects them.
At one of our meetings about creating a video, members of Disability Unite joined us to give input.
We discussed our parade plans and their festival plans for today.
We discussed how working together could benefit people with disabilities such as autism, aphasia, and ADHD.
Collaborate with disability organizations across the US to help people with cognitive disabilities such as autism, aphasia, and ADHD.
We, people with disabilities, show pride in ourselves, in each other, and in supporting each other during the pandemic.
We have been caring for each other and offering support so that we can all be part of the community.
We should show love, defend each other, and provide help to one another in these times.
Let's join together and show our pride for disabilities! We can organize parades, festivals, and other events to create awareness and keep it going for years.
Thank you for giving me this opportunity.
We are grateful to Matt and Elizabeth Axel for connecting with the Chicago Disability Pride Parade Committee and Disability Unite.
We are excited to partner with you soon.
Thank you for giving me the opportunity to do this.
I wish everyone a great time at the festival!
Let's celebrate and have fun together in honor of disability pride.
Thank you for your help.
Hey everyone!
Hi, I'm Lachi. Nice to meet you.
Let's celebrate and recognize how great our community is!
People with disabilities have many different identities, backgrounds, and experiences.
I am a multi-talented person. I can act, sing, and write.
I am Black, visually impaired, and I have a beautiful soul.
We come from different backgrounds and experiences.
We make things with love.
We are thankful for 30 years of recognition and we look forward to having this for many more years.
I am pleased to present Evan Ruggiero to you. My name is Laura Benanti.
Evan is from New Jersey and is proud to be from there.
At age 5, he began playing the drums. When he was a college sophomore at Montclair State University, he received a diagnosis of an uncommon form of cancer.
He had nine surgeries in six months and chose to amputate his leg.
After the surgery 18 months ago, he received a peg leg and was able to tap again two days later.
He is brave and inspiring.
He is a great gift to us all, and he is able to bring joy and entertainment to many famous people, such as Ellen DeGeneres, the Bidens, and the Oscars.
That's amazing.
He was nominated for an award given to outstanding dancers, called the Chita Rivera Dance Award.
He's amazing.
He is kind and that makes a big difference.
Nice to meet you, this is him.
Hi, I'm Thomas Ellenson. I'm excited to introduce Ryan Niemiller. Ryan is a great comedian and also a role model for disabled actors and comedians like me.
I wrote my own material to get a job opportunity.
Though I do not identify as a disabled actor or comedian, I acknowledge and recognize the challenges faced by those with disabilities such as autism, aphasia, and ADHD.
I am more than just my disability.
My humor is not limited to one source.
Ryan has said that laughing helped him a lot.
Bullying can happen when people are different from others. In my case, it's because I don't sound the same as other people.
If someone is making fun of you, use humor to respond to them.
Ryan is known for his ability to make people laugh, even though he has a disability.
The power of laughter helps people come together and brings joy to life. It has been beneficial to Ryan and many others.
I'm excited to present Cripple Threat Ryan Niemiller, a beloved performer from America's Got Talent.
Thank you all.
Hi everyone!
I'm Victor Calise. I'm the Commissioner of the Mayor's Office for People With Disabilities.
We're excited to welcome everyone to the Disability Unite Festival! This is the first-ever event of its kind and we can't wait to celebrate!
We are thrilled to offer you an amazing variety of activities, including music, dance, art, conversation, gaming, and more.
We are grateful to the members of the New York City Mayor's Office for People With Disabilities and the Disability Community Consortium Project, Access For All, for making this event possible.
We have put together an amazing celebration, even though times have been tough, with help from our partners in communities across the nation.
Our country is facing difficult times.
Our community has worked hard to overcome difficulties.
Working together makes us stronger, and when we work together, we have success.
This event celebrates the 30th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act. This law guarantees equal rights and opportunities for everyone.
We are celebrating the 50th anniversary of Disabled in Action (DIA), a civil rights organization based in New York City.
We thank the leaders of DIA for fighting for our rights to access disability accommodations. They protested, held sit-ins, and even chained themselves to buses to get us these rights.
We support and strengthen our nation's diverse communities, including people of color and LGBTQ people, through civil rights movements.
We owe thanks to civil rights movements for making the disability rights movement stronger. Let's keep supporting them.
Since the Americans with Disabilities Act was passed and signed, there have been great improvements in the rights of people with disabilities in all aspects of life.
Let's celebrate this July and keep fighting for what we believe in.
Celebrate our community and ourselves at the Disability Unite Festival! Embrace our individuality and all the things that make us special.
This platform helps promote fairness and equality for all.
No matter where we are, we still form a community.
We all have our own communities inside us.
We express ourselves through our speech, behavior, affection, and support of ourselves, our loved ones, and our community.
Together, we are powerful.
We are working together to create change, we have made great strides in advocating for disability rights, and we will keep going until everyone in the U.S. has the same access and opportunities.
Have fun at the festival. I hope we can meet in person next year.
We celebrate people with disabilities during Disability Pride Month.
We're glad you're here!
We will showcase artists from different types of music and at different levels of their careers.
The Americans with Disabilities Act is important for our work.
Art can be a great way for people with cognitive disabilities such as autism, aphasia, and ADHD to express themselves.
We guarantee that everyone can do this.
We observe a lot of different artists and arts groups now.
The Americans with Disabilities Act is not enough to provide complete support and resources for people with cognitive disabilities such as autism, aphasia, and ADHD.
Access should be thought of as a series of practices, not just rules and regulations.
Let's start creating our future today.
Hi, I'm Miranda.
I work to make sure people with disabilities can enjoy Lincoln Center's performances.
We are excited to present two new pieces that are part of our series about making art accessible for people with autism, aphasia, and ADHD.
Heidi Latsky Dance, a group we have collaborated with at Lincoln Center for a long time, will perform first.
We admire her work.
This is a piece of music called "Solo Flight ADA 30".
Fifteen artists, both disabled and non-disabled, are sharing what it's like to be isolated during this time.
Have fun!
Watch a video from Lincoln Center's ADA in the Arts Series about making the arts more accessible for people with disabilities.
Queens Theater is working with us to provide opportunities for people with cognitive disabilities, such as autism, aphasia, and ADHD.
Makena Metz's story "Death Bites" is being read online by disabled artists.
We wish you to have a good experience.
Hi, I'm Rebecca Cokely. I'm the director of the Disability Justice Initiative at the Center for American Progress.
Jackson Santi is an up-and-coming poet and spoken word artist from Chicago.
His poem shows he has a bright future.
Enjoy Jackson Santi's original song, "Photosynthesis and Other Life Lessons".

Welcome to the Disability Unite Festival! This is a celebration of people with disabilities and the contributions we make to our communities.
The Disability Unite Festival is a celebration of the 30th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act. It was created by the Disability Community Consortium, Project Access for All, and the Mayor's Office for People With Disabilities.
Project Access for All is a collaboration of individuals and organizations that work together to make something happen.
This festival is organized by our community, for our community.
Victor Calise, New York City's Commissioner, made this possible. You just heard from him.
He assembled an amazing team.
Jonathan Novick leads weekly phone calls to help people in New York City get through the coronavirus pandemic. These calls have been very helpful in keeping communication open.
We in the disability community got to know each other better and worked together.
Cities are working together to support people with disabilities during this challenging time.
The result of this crisis is good.
Disability groups from all over the world are working together and growing quickly.
Today marks 30 years since the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act and 50 years since Disabled in Action was founded.
We are excited to have Jean Ryan, the president, here to open the Disability Unite Festival.
Disabled in Action (DIA) is a civil rights organization that works to end discrimination against people with all types of disabilities. DIA helps us break down barriers to achieve full equality in American society.
Jean, do you want to share some thoughts?
Thank you for your kind attention.
For the past 50 years, people have used meetings, emails, legal action, and protests to fight for their rights. Some people have even been arrested.
You said something about Commissioner Calise and how he impacts our community.
I would like to highlight his appointment to the MTA Board.
Commissioner Calise has the experience and skills to do the job, and the community worked together to make the appointment possible.
It is important for us to have a seat at the table and be leaders. We must make sure we have people like Commissioner Calise to advocate for us.
I'm thrilled about Disability Unite!
We have power because DIA has the backing of thousands of people with disabilities and their supporters.
I completely agree, Jean.
We all have the ability to make the changes we want.
We invite you to the Disability Unite Festival to have fun, be creative, make friends, and work together to create a more equitable and accessible world for people with disabilities.
Hello, I'm Chelsie.
I started the Rollettes Wheelchair Dance Team.
Our team consists of amazing women with various disabilities, and they refuse to let their disabilities limit them.
Our mission is to help women with disabilities feel strong and confident, and to give them the opportunity to express themselves through dance.
We have been featured on several major media outlets including NowThis, Huffington Post, BuzzFeed, the Today Show, Good Morning America, Instagram, and the Ellen Show.
Visit RollettesDance.com and find us on social media.
We are thrilled to join the Disability Unite Virtual Festival!
We are thrilled to have the Rollettes Dance Team here!
Six people â€“ Steph Aiello, Samantha Lopez, Conner Lundius, Edna Serrano, Maria Rabaino, and Chelsie Hill â€“ singing We Can Together.
Gender equality is everyone's issue.
It is important for society and the economy.
Including people with disabilities in employment is important for more than just equality; it helps a company succeed.
We need to take action now to achieve gender equality. It's not enough to wait more than 100 years to have an equal number of women in leadership roles or more than 257 years to close the gender pay gap. We must act now to make sure that gender equality is achieved.
We cannot delay striving for equality, access, and inclusion for everyone while spreading our message.
Let's spread the idea of fairness and equal opportunities for people with disabilities, people of color, and LGBTQ people.
Together, we can make a difference.
The Female Quotient helps organizations help people of all genders achieve fairness and success.
We are working to create equal opportunities in the workplace and media by taking action to bring about change, tracking results, and helping companies become more inclusive.
We help business leaders make their organizations more equal. We give them research, tools, and experiences. We also wrote The Modern Guide to Equality, a book with ideas to help them create change.
We are excited to work with Disability Unite and the disability community together.
