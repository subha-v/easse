Hello, everyone.
Happy 30th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act!
Thank you for organizing a great event.
Thanks to Corey and Elizabeth for asking me to join.
November is coming soon - let's go out and vote!
Your choices and voices are important right now.
It's important that everyone speaks up in November, no matter what your views are.
Find out where your polling place is.
Remember, there are absentee ballot options and other options depending on your situation.
We are the largest population, so it is important that we get equal rights in our voices and choices.
Remember to go out and vote in November.
Will you notice me if I don't speak up?
This is a course to help you review.
Are we all using separate vehicles?
Cars, trucks, bikes, wheelchairs, motorized chairs, canes, crutches.
Please be aware and make changes so we can all reach our destination.
I said this is an unusual time.
4 Wheel City is grateful for everyone.
This is 4 Wheel City.
Thank you for joining us this evening.
My name is Gha'il Rhodes Benjamin, like I said before.
I support disabled people.
We all share the same air.
Maya Angelou said we have a lot in common.
Wish you a great summer.
Be safe.
We care about you.
Thank you for being here.
Bye for now.
Welcome to the Disability Unite Festival, everyone!
I am Gha'il Rhodes Benjamin.
I'm glad to be here with you tonight.
We have been waiting for this moment.
The powerful moment is called "It Just Had to be Said".
We artists in this next segment will talk about our protest of 2020 and how it affects us, you and I, as we redefine our identities.
These artists will tell you like it is.
Now I can tell you more about me.
My name is Gha'il Rhodes Benjamin, I am a performance spoken-word artist.
I wrote and performed this piece, it is called Global Libations.
This memorial is for those heroes and sheroes who are no longer with us, leaving behind families and loved ones.
Global Drinks.
Zazel O'Garra is the founder and director of ZCO Dance Project and is very powerful.
She is very influential in the art world.
Nothing can stop her.
Zazel can do anything!
She is amazing!
Her dancers can do amazing things.
They travel easily through space and time.
They don't seem to ever stop.
They are determined to overcome any obstacle.
In this new piece called "We the People" choreographed by Wendy Powell, you'll see what I mean.
Lift your hands up.
Be prepared.
Now, ZCO Dance Project is here.
Go, ZCO!
Hello, Andrea.
Welcome to the Disability Night platform.
Thank you for joining us today.
We are so happy you are here.
People call you the seated nurse.
Can you tell us a bit about yourself and your disability?
Yes, I'm the nurse who sits down.
I am the first wheelchair user to become a nurse in New York City and I have transverse myelitis.
When I was 5, I got diagnosed, and at 12 I stopped walking.
That's amazing!
You are very skilled and talented.
We've been friends for a long time.
You were also Miss Wheelchair New York.
Why did you want to become a nurse?
I didn't always want to be a nurse.
We talked a while back about how important representation is, right?
I didn't see nurses that looked like me - a woman, a woman of color, and a woman with a disability.
I wanted to become a doctor.
I wanted to be a lawyer before that.
I wanted to give back and help someone else on my journey to reach my goals.
Medical school teaches us how diseases affect the body.
I didn't want to treat someone unfairly.
I wanted to care for them, so nursing was the perfect job.
As a nurse in a wheelchair, do you think it helped you relate to patients in any way?
Yes, definitely.
Having a disability gives you a unique perspective that someone else may not have.
Some people think having a disability is like a death sentence.
Nurses with disabilities show that life goes on, even in a hospital or clinic.
You are giving them hope and a new life, even when doctors and nurses without disabilities can't.
It's a unique view.
We're innovators, so we get a special reward.
We know how to plan ahead.
Yes, thatâ€™s right.
You helped during the COVID-19 crisis.
Can you tell us more about that and your experiences?
COVID had a big effect in New York, it was like a tornado went through.
Many people are sick and recovering from this, and it will be a long journey.
They say this is our new normal, right?
We don't want to be stuck inside.
We don't want our loved ones to get sick or experience the effects of COVID.
We with disabilities know what it's like to be excluded and scared to go to hospitals or clinics. We understand this life better.
We can adjust to it better than most people.
We can now stand up and say, we understand this situation.
Tell us your stories.
Let's help each other get through this, together.
Yes, that's correct.
What is your advice to our community during this pandemic?
Many people have had to be isolated, which is different than usual.
What tips can you give to help them stay healthy?
Stay away from large groups of people for now.
Remember to wash your hands.
Remember to go to your appointments, OK?
Don't stay away from clinics and hospitals, it's bad for your health.
Go to the doctor and get the treatments you need.
We want to stay healthy.
We need to talk to our doctors to do that.
As a nurse, I have seen all the precautions taken in COVID buildings to keep us safe.
Remember to take care of yourself.
Go outside.
Call someone you know.
You are not alone.
Yes, for sure.
What advice would you give someone younger than you wanting to be a nurse or work in health care?
It was probably hard for you to be understood and accepted into that community.
It was a difficult challenge.
This job needs to understand that disability doesn't mean someone can't do it.
I can still help you even if I'm seated.
We are sometimes biased against ourselves with the same beliefs, like we can't do something because it's for someone who walks, or how can we lift something?
What are some ways to do something?
We do things in our own way.
No matter what abilities you have, we can find creative solutions together.
Sometimes you need help, sometimes you can do it alone.
Remember, what others think of us does not define us.
You can choose how to enter this field and what your story will be.
No one else can decide that.
That's lovely.
Where will Andrea be in 10 years?
I am taking a Master's course in nursing education. I hope to get a Doctorate of Nursing Practice in the coming years.
I want to help our community.
It is important to have healthcare workers who understand disabilities and can provide quality care.
We should do more than just treat, we should also understand.
That's lovely.
Thank you Andrea Dalzell for joining us at Disability Unite.
You are helping our community move forward. So, thank you. I am inspired by you every day.
Thank you for joining us today, we wish you luck and will stay in touch.
Thank you, Corey.
Thanks everyone!
Be safe.
Goodbye.

Hello, I'm Jeff Tweedy from Wilco. Gaelynn Lea is the next performer.
We met a few years ago at a festival in Montana.
When I met Gaelynn, I felt like we had been friends or family forever.
She performed with Wilco.
She won a Tiny Desk Concert in 2016 and then traveled with her husband.
She has performed in 45 states and 9 countries, and now she has a show on YouTube every Sunday.
She works hard to make the world a better place.
I really love her.
I'm excited for you to watch her show.
Hi, everyone!
Hi, my name is Justin Cooper. I am part of the Chicago Disability Pride Parade Committee.
I'm so proud to be part of this festival.
Usually during Disability Pride Month, we have parades and events to show our disability pride.
COVID has changed how we show our events, so we need new strategies.
We made a video in Chicago with committee members, sharing what the Disability Pride Parade and 30th Anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act mean to them.
We had members from Disability Unite join us when we talked about the video process.
We talked about our parade plans and their virtual festival plans.
We talked about how we could work together to help our disability communities.
This means working with lots of disability organizations in different places all over the USA.
We are proud to be people with disabilities, to show solidarity and support each other during the pandemic.
We have been helping each other and giving resources to be part of the community.
We should keep loving, fighting, and supporting each other during these times.
Let's organize disability pride parades and festivals to create awareness now and in the future.
Thank you for giving me this time.
I want to thank Matt and Elizabeth Axel for connecting with the Chicago Disability Pride Parade Committee and Disability Unite.
The committee is excited to work with you soon.
Thank you for giving me this opportunity.
I hope this festival is really good!
Let's celebrate disability pride and have a good time.
Thanks!
Hi everyone!
Hello, my name is Lachi.
We are here to celebrate our community and how great we all are.
The disability community is connected in many ways.
I'm an actor, singer, and writer. Plus more!
I'm a black and blind woman who is beautiful.
We are all different.
We are creative and full of love.
We are thankful for the regulations that have recognized us for 30 years. Here's to more years like that!
Hello, I'm Laura Benanti. I'm honored to introduce Evan Ruggiero to you.
Evan is from New Jersey, we are Jersey for life!
He started tapping when he was 5 years old. Later, in college, he was diagnosed with a rare cancer.
He needed nine surgeries in six months and had to decide to amputate his leg.
He got his peg leg two days after his surgery, and then he was able to tap dance again 18 months later.
He is very brave and inspiring.
He has done amazing things and performed for Ellen DeGeneres, the Bidens, and at the Oscars.
That's amazing!
He was nominated for the Drama Desk and Chita Rivera Dance Awards.
He is an amazing person.
He is kind, which is very important.
Thank you for having me, and here he is.
Hi, I'm Thomas Ellenson. I'm so happy to introduce Ryan Niemiller. He's a great comedian and a role model for disabled actors and comics like me.
I wrote my own material and hoped this would help people hire me.
But like Ryan, I don't think of myself as a disabled actor or comedian.
Disability is part of who I am.
My humor is not limited to one source.
Ryan said that laughter helped him a lot.
Kids can be mean if you look or speak differently.
Using humor can help you when bullies are teasing you.
Ryan is known as the Cripple Threat for his powerful use of humor.
Ryan talks about how laughter can bring joy and bring people together, including me.
It's my pleasure to introduce Cripple Threat Ryan Niemiller from America's Got Talent.
Thank you all.
Hi, everyone!
My name is Victor Calise and I'm the Commissioner for the Mayor's Office for People With Disabilities.
Welcome to the first Disability Unite Festival.
We are excited to offer music, dance, art, discussion, gaming, and more.
I thank the NYC Mayor's Office for People with Disabilities and Access For All for making this event happen.
We worked with partners in our community to make a celebration, even though it's hard right now.
Our country is in a difficult time with lots of changes and sadness.
I have seen our community be strong and overcome.
Working together makes us stronger and helps us succeed.
We are celebrating 30 years since the Americans with Disabilities Act was passed. This law said that everyone is equal and should have the same chances.
We also celebrate Disabled in Action (DIA), a civil rights organization that was founded 50 years ago in New York City.
We are thankful to the leaders of DIA who fought for us to have disability accommodations that we have today, like protests, sit-ins, and even chaining themselves to buses.
We respect our nation's communities of color, LGBTQ community, and civil rights movements. They help and make each other strong.
The disability rights movement is stronger because of other civil rights movements, so thank you and keep supporting them.
ADA has made it possible for people with disabilities to have more rights in all areas of life.
We can celebrate in July, but we must keep advocating for change.
The Disability Unite Festival is the time to celebrate our community, our individuality, and what makes us unique and amazing.
This is a platform to help make everyone equal.
Our community is still here, even when we are apart.
We all have community inside us.
It influences how we talk, act, love, and support ourselves, our families, friends, and neighbors.
Together, we are powerful.
We have made a lot of progress in fighting for disability rights and we will keep going until everyone has the same access and opportunity.
Have fun at the festival, I hope to see everyone in person next year.
Celebrate Disability Pride Month!
We are showcasing artists from many genres at different levels of their careers.
The ADA is important for our work.
It suggests that disabled people may create art.
It helps us get the access we need.
We have lots of artists and art groups today because of this.
The ADA isn't enough.
Disability art helps us think of access as something we can practice, not just follow rules for.
We can create our future starting now.
Hi, I'm Miranda Hoffner.
I help make Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts accessible. My title is assistant director of accessibility.
I'm happy to show you two pieces from our ADA in the Arts series.
Our first partner is Heidi Latsky Dance, they have been working with us at Lincoln Center for a long time.
We really appreciate her work.
This is a piece called SOLO FLIGHT ADA 30.
This features 15 artists, with and without disabilities, telling us about their experience of being isolated.
Have fun!
This next video is part of Lincoln Center's ADA in the Arts Series.
Queens Theater and Queens Theater for All Initiative are working together on this.
Makena Metz wrote "Death Bites," and it is performed, written, and directed by disabled artists.
We hope you like it.
Hello, I am Rebecca Cokely. I am the director of the Disability Justice Initiative at the Center for American Progress.
Jackson Santi is a poet and artist from Chicago who is starting his career.
When you hear his poem, you'll know he has a great future.
Jackson Santi is performing his song, "Photosynthesis and Other Life Lessons".
Hi, I'm Ricky McKinnie from the Blind Boys of Alabama. Singing brings us together.
Welcome to the first Disability Unite Festival! We are celebrating everything about disability.
The Disability Unite Festival was created to honor the 30th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act and was supported by the Disability Community Consortium, Project Access for All, and the New York City Mayor's Office for People With Disabilities.
Project Access for All is a group of people and organizations who work together to make good things happen.
This festival is for us, by us.
Victor Calise, New York City's Commissioner, made this happen and you just heard from him.
He has an amazing team.
Jonathan Novick hosts weekly phone calls to help New York City through the coronavirus pandemic and the communication has been great.
The disability community got to know each other better and worked together.
We can see the national network of Mayor's Offices for People With Disabilities supporting each other during these tough times.
This has been a good result from this crisis.
We have seen many disability groups join together from all over the world.
This year marks the 30th anniversary of the ADA and the 50th anniversary of Disabled in Action.
We are honored to have Jean Ryan, President of Disability Unite, here to do the virtual ribbon cutting and start the Festival.
DIA (Disabled in Action) fights for disabled people to have full equality and to stop discrimination.
Jean, do you have anything you want to say?
Thanks!
We have had 50 years of meetings, emails, lawsuits, sit-ins, and some arrests.
Matt, you talked about Commissioner Calise's part in our community.
I want to recognize his appointment to the Metropolitan Transit Authority Board, also known as the MTA.
Commissioner Calise has the right skills, and people worked together to get her appointed.
It's important that we always have a place at the table and we should work to find leaders like Commissioner Calise to push for appointments.
I am very excited about Disability Unite.
Thousands of disabled people and allies support DIA, giving us power.
Yes, Jean, I agree.
We have the power to make changes together.
We hope everyone enjoys the Disability Unite Festival. Let's work together to make our communities accessible and inclusive for everyone, including people with disabilities.

Gender equality affects everyone, not just women.
It is important for social and economic reasons.
It's important to include people with disabilities in employment. It's good for the business and for everyone's success.
We need to close the gender pay gap and have gender parity in the C-suite soon, not wait 100 or 257 years.
We can't wait for everyone to have equality, access, and inclusion as we spread our message.
Let's spread the message of equal rights for people with disabilities, communities of color, and LGBTQ communities.
The Female Quotient helps organizations get more out of equality.
We are helping companies become equal and more accountable, and creating solutions for change.
We give business leaders tools and research to help create equality, and we publish The Modern Guide to Equality, a book of ideas for making change.
We are excited to work with Disability Unite and the disability community.
