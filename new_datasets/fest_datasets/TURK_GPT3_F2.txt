Hi, everyone.
Andy Arias is an actor and an advocate.
Happy Americans with Disabilities Act 30th anniversary.
Disabilityunite.org is an organization that is doing great work to help people with disabilities. If you know anyone with a disability, or if you yourself have a disability, I encourage you to check out their website and see how you can help make a difference.
Thank you for hosting an amazing event.
Thank you, Corey and Elizabeth, for inviting me to do this.
If you are a United States citizen, November is the month when you can go out and vote for the president.
Your choices and voices are important.
Whether you are a Democrat or a Republican, your vote is important in the upcoming election.
You should know where your polling place is.
There may be other options available for voting if you cannot vote in person. Check with your local election officials to see if there are absentee ballot options available.
Our population is the largest, so we should have an equal say in what happens on the planet.
It is important to go out and vote in November.
If I don't say anything, will you notice me?
This event is for people who want to learn more about wheelchairs and how they can improve their mobility. Attendees will have the opportunity to try out different types of wheelchairs, learn about the latest wheelchair technology, and hear from experts about how to live a fuller life with a wheelchair.
This is a course to help people remember things.
We all travel in different vehicles.
Cars, trucks, bicycles, wheelchairs, motorized wheelchairs, canes, and crutches are all types of transportation.
Please be aware of others around you and kindly make adjustments so that everyone can get to where they are going.
This is a unique time and space.
Thank you for your continued support!
4 Wheel City is a place where you can buy four-wheeled vehicles.
Thank you for spending the evening with us.
My name is Gha'il Rhodes Benjamin.
I am an ally of people with disabilities.
We all share the same air.
We are all in this together.
We have a lot in common with each other.
I hope you enjoy the warm weather and have a great time!
This means that you should try to avoid dangerous situations and protect yourself from harm.
We care about you.
Thank you for being here.
We'll see each other later.
Welcome to the Disability Unite Festival. We're glad you're here.
My name is Gha'il Rhodes Benjamin.
I'm happy to be here with you this evening.
This is the moment we've all been anticipating.
This moment is titled "It Just Had to be Said" because it is powerful.
In this next segment, the artists are protesting what has happened in 2020. They are saying what needs to be said about the fear, outrage, and defiance that we all feel. They are letting us know that we need to redefine our identities.
These artists tell it like it is.
I am excited to tell you some things about myself.
Hi, my name is Gha'il Rhodes Benjamin, and I'm a performance spoken-word artist.
This piece, written and performed by me, is titled "Global Libations."
It's a memorial for people who have died. It honors the people who have died and the people who are left behind.
Global Libations is a beverage company.
Zazel O'Garra, the founder and artistic director of ZCO Dance Project, is very talented and successful.
She's a powerful force in the art industry.
She is unstoppable.
Zazel is unstoppable. No one and nothing can stop her.
She's amazing.
Her dancers are very good at jumping and flipping.
They move through space and time easily.
Some people never seem to stop talking.
This means that they are very determined and that this determination helps them succeed even when the odds are against them.
This piece, called "We the People", is choreographed by Wendy Powell. You'll see what I mean when you watch it.
Put your hands up in the air.
It's time to go.It's time to go.
The ZCO Dance Project is happening right now.
This means "go to the zero crossing point."
Hi, my name is Andrea.
Welcome to the Disability Night platform. This is a space for people with disabilities to connect with each other and share resources.
Thank you for coming today.
Thank you for coming.
You are the nurse who sits down.
I am a person with a cognitive disability. I have trouble with some mental tasks and with understanding some things. I need help with things like reading and writing.
I'm the nurse who is sitting down.
I'm the first registered nurse in New York City to graduate from nursing school while using a wheelchair. I also have transverse myelitis.
I was diagnosed with a cognitive disability when I was five years old, and I stopped walking completely when I was 12 years old.
Great.
You're very smart and good at what you do.
We've been friends for a while.
You were also Miss Wheelchair New York.
Why did you choose to become a nurse?
I didn't always want to be a nurse.
We had spoken about how important it is to have someone who looks like us in a position of power.
I didn't see people who look like me as a nurse with a disability.
I wanted to become a medical doctor.
I wanted to be a lawyer before I became a teacher.
I wanted to help people, so I thought about being of service to someone else.
Medical school teaches you how to treat diseases.
I didn't want to treat someone as if they were sick.
I wanted to help people, so I became a nurse.
So as a nurse, do you think that being in a wheelchair makes you more relatable to patients and gives you some benefits?
Oh, 100%.
Being in a seated position or with any disability brings a perspective that somebody might not have.
Disability is not a death sentence.
But when you come into nursing and you already have your disability, the person you're caring for knows that life goes on outside of the hospital or clinic.
You are giving them a new lease on life by providing hope that may not come from a doctor or nurse that does not have a disability.
It's a different way of looking at things.
We're constantly innovating and coming up with new, creative solutions- and that's one of the best parts about working here.
We are good at thinking ahead.
That's right.You are exactly right.
You were on the front lines of the COVID-19 crisis.
What would you like to know about my experiences?
COVID hit New York hard and it was like a tornado came through.
This is a never-ending journey from here on out.
This new way of living is the new normal.
This is not something I want.
We don't want to be restricted or have our movements limited in any way.
We want our loved ones to be healthy and free from the effects of COVID-19.
We know what it is like to be excluded, to be afraid of going out, and to feel alone. So we are better prepared to deal with this situation.
We can manage changes better than most people.
We understand what it's like to face discrimination and to be misunderstood. We know what it's like to be treated differently, and we're here to stand up for you.
We want to hear your stories. Please share them with us.
We're all in this together. Let's help each other get through it.
That's what I was thinking.I agree with you completely.
The best advice for people during this pandemic is to stay home as much as possible, wash your hands often, and avoid close contact with others.
Since many people have been isolated recently, which is different from our usual routines.
There are many things you can do to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Eating a balanced diet and exercising regularly are two important things you can do to stay healthy. Additionally, avoiding tobacco and excessive alcohol use can help you maintain a healthy lifestyle.
It's a good idea to try to avoid being in big crowds right now.
Wear a mask if you have to go out.
It's important to wash your hands to stay clean and healthy.
Appointments are important. Don't miss them.
You are only jeopardizing your health when you stay away from clinics and hospitals.
It's important to keep up with your medical appointments and treatments.
We want to make sure that we're staying healthy.
We need to follow up with our physicians to ensure that we are healthy and doing well.
They're taking every precaution to make sure we stay healthy when we enter those settings.
You should take care of yourself.
This means go outside and get some fresh air.
If you want to talk to a friend, you can call them.
You are not alone in this. There are others who are going through the same thing.
Cognitive disabilities can make it hard to understand complex language. So, we've simplified the language on this page.
Somebody who wants to be a nurse or work in the health care industry should get a degree in a related field, such as health science or biology. They should also consider volunteering in a hospital or other health care facility to get experience.
It wasn't easy for you to be understood and accepted into that community.
This was a difficult task.
People with cognitive disabilities can still be successful in this profession as long as they understand that their disability does not mean they are unable to do the job.
I can still help you even though I'm sitting down.
We need to think about ways that we can make things more accessible for people with cognitive disabilities, instead of always assuming that they can't do something.
How can you do something?
We do things differently than other people.
We have different ways of being innovative in how we come up to a solution, depending on our abilities.
Sometimes you need help, and sometimes you can do it by yourself.
Remember that not everyone's perception of you defines who you are.
You get to choose what your story is going to be.
No one else gets to decide that.
That is pretty.
Andrea will be in her mid-30s in 10 years. She will likely be married and have children. She will probably be working as a doctor or a lawyer.
I am studying to become a nurse educator. My goal is to earn a Doctor of Nursing Practice degree within the next few years.
I want to help our community.
It's very important that we have healthcare workers who understand the lives of people with disabilities, and can treat them accordingly.
We should not just treat people with cognitive disabilities, but also try to understand them.
That is a very pretty picture.
Thank you for having me.
You make a difference in the lives of others and inspire them to be their best.
Thank you for being a part of our community and helping us move forward. You inspire me and others every day.
Thank you for joining us today. We wish you the best of luck and we will be following your progress.
Thank you, Corey.
Thank you all.
This is a message telling the person to be careful.
This person is saying goodbye.
Full Radius Dance will be performing next.
Full Radius Dance is a professional dance company based in Atlanta that includes dancers with and without physical disabilities.
The company believes that people with cognitive disabilities can create power, passion, and innovation through performing arts, especially dance.
Full Radius Dance performs a lot in Atlanta, as well as in other parts of the US, and in other countries.
The company will be performing Re-Emerge, which is the first in a three-part series with the overall title of Return.
This video is a response to the self-quarantining necessary due to COVID-19. It was created for the camera with music by Andrew Choe.
What does this mean for the future? How will things change when we are able to re-emerge from the current situation?
This dance is called "Re-Emerge" and it was made by the dancers themselves under the direction of Douglas Scott.
You can find Full Radius Dance online at www.fullradiusdance.org. Twitter and Instagram are @FullRadiusDance.
Hi, I'm Jeff Tweedy from Wilco, and the next performer is Gaelynn Lea.
We met a few years ago at a festival in Montana.
Gaelynn is one of those people that you instantly feel like you know them your whole life when you meet them. You feel like you are friends or family.
She has performed with Wilco.
In 2016, she won a Tiny Desk Concert. After that, she and her husband hit the road.
She started doing a show on YouTube every Sunday 45 states and nine countries later.
She is always working to make the world a better place.
She's the best thing that's ever happened to me.
I'm excited to see her perform.
Hello everyone.
My name is Justin Cooper, and I help plan the Chicago Disability Pride Parade.
Thank you for having me! I'm excited to be here and to share my work with all of you.
I'm thankful for Disability Unite for giving me a chance to speak to all of you.
Now, normally during Disability Pride Month, we celebrate our disability pride through various parades and events throughout the country.
But because of the effects of COVID, we've all had to change our strategies on how we showcase our events.
We worked on a video with members of our committee, sharing our thoughts on what our disability pride parade and also the 30th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act means to them.
We were discussing the video process with members of Disability Unite.
We talked about our plans for the parade and their plans for the virtual festival.
We talked about how we could help each other out and make things better for people with disabilities.
I want to work with disability organizations all over the country to help people with cognitive disabilities.
We people with disabilities take pride in who we are, and in supporting each other during these times of a pandemic.
We have always been there for each other and have provided resources to help us live our lives and be a part of the community.
We need to keep caring for each other, fighting for each other, and helping each other through these tough times.
We need to work together to put on disability pride parades and festivals to create awareness. This is important work that we need to keep doing for many years to come.
Thank you for your time.
I want to thank Matt and Elizabeth Axel for contacting the Chicago Disability Pride Parade Committee and Disability Unite.
We are looking forward to working with you all in the future.
Thank you for letting me do this.
I hope this is a great festival today.
Let's have a good time and celebrate disability pride.
Thank you for supporting us.
Hey, everyone.
This is Lachi.
We are here to celebrate our community and how awesome each and every one of us are.
People with cognitive disabilities have a lot in common with other marginalized groups. They experience discrimination and prejudice in many areas of their lives. This is called intersectionality.
Look at me, I'm a triple threat. I can act, sing and write.
I'm black and blind, and I'm a beautiful woman.
We come from different places and have different backgrounds.
We're creative and full of love.
We're grateful that we've been recognized by regulation for 30 years. Here's to 30 more years.
Hi, my name is Laura Benanti and it is my honor to introduce Evan Ruggiero to you.
Evan is from New Jersey and he is proud to be from there.
He started tapping when he was 5 years old. When he was a sophomore at Montclair State University, he was diagnosed with a very rare form of cancer.
He had to have nine surgeries in six months and had to make the very difficult decision to amputate his leg.
18 months after surgery, he received his peg leg and started tapping again.
He is a brave and inspiring person.
It's great that he's still performing for people like Ellen DeGeneres and the Bidens.
That's amazing.
He's a nominee for the Drama Desk and Chita Rivera Dance Awards.
He is an amazing person.
He's a nice guy and that's important.
Here's the person you wanted to talk to.
Hey, I'm Thomas Ellenson. I'm really pleased to introduce Ryan Niemiller. He's a funny guy and a trailblazer for disabled actors and comics.
I copied what he did and wrote my own stuff so that people would give me a chance and hire me.
I don't consider myself to be a disabled actor or comedian.
Disability is one aspect of my life, but it does not define me.
This means that my sense of humor is not limited to just this one thing.
In interviews, Ryan has described how laughter saved him early on.
Kids can be cruel to people who are different from them.
When bullies might make fun, using humor is a great tool.
Ryan is known as the Cripple Threat because he is funny.
Ryan has said that laughter is a powerful force that brings people together and makes life more joyful. He has said that it has had a positive impact on his own life.
It's my pleasure to introduce the guy we know and love from America's Got Talent, Cripple Threat Ryan Niemiller.
I appreciate your feedback.Thank you all for your feedback. I appreciate it.
Hello, everyone.
Hi, my name is Victor Calise, and I work as the Commissioner for the Mayor's Office for People With Disabilities. My job is to help make sure that people with disabilities have the same opportunities and access to resources as everyone else.
The Disability Unite Festival is a celebration of people with disabilities. It is a place for people with disabilities to come together and celebrate their abilities. The festival will feature performances, workshops, and speeches from people with disabilities.
This program has a lot of different activities that will be fun and engaging. There will be music, dance, art, discussion, gaming, and more. This is a great opportunity to experience a lot of different things and have some fun.
Thank you to the members of the New York City Mayor's Office for People With Disabilities and the Disability Community Consortium Project, Access For All, for making this event possible.
We've organized an incredible celebration with our community partners around the country during a difficult time.
Our country is going through a tough time.
I have seen our community come together to overcome difficult situations.
We work better when we work together. We are stronger when we work together. We succeed when we work together.
This event is to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act. This act was passed 30 years ago and it states that everyone is equal and should have the same opportunities.
We are also celebrating the 50th anniversary of Disabled in Action, a civil rights organization that started in New York City.
Today, we share gratitude to the leaders of DIA who fought for us to have the disability accommodations that we have today. Thank you!
We also recognize the struggles of our nation's communities of color and LGBTQ community. Civil rights movements help and strengthen each other.
The disability rights movement is stronger because of the civil rights movements that happened before it. We are grateful for what those movements did and continue to support them.
This means that since the Americans with Disabilities Act was passed, disabled people have gotten more rights in many areas of life.
We have a lot to celebrate in July, but we also know that we need to keep working for what we believe in.
The Disability Unite Festival is a time for celebrating our community, individuality, and the parts of ourselves that make us unique and amazing.
This is a platform that will help us achieve equality and inclusion for everyone.
A community can be defined as a group of people who share a common interest, who are connected to each other in some way, or who live in the same area.
This means that the community is not just a physical place, but it is also something that exists inside of each person.
It's about how we treat other people.
We are stronger than we think when we work together.
We can make change happen by working together. We have made progress in the fight for disability rights, and we will continue fighting until everyone in this country has the same access and opportunity.
Now enjoy the festival. I hope to see you all next year in person.
This is a message to say happy Disability Pride Month.
We're happy to have you here.
We will be featuring artists from different genres who are at different stages in their careers.
The ADA is a law that helps to protect people with disabilities.
Making art can be a fun and rewarding activity for people with cognitive disabilities. It can help them express themselves and communicate their ideas.
This means that we are allowed to do what we need to do.
Different artists and arts groups exist because people have different preferences for art.
The ADA is not enough to help people with cognitive disabilities.
Disability artistry is about creating art that is accessible to everyone, regardless of their cognitive abilities. This means that instead of thinking of access as a series of rules or regulations, we should think of it as a series of practices.
Our future begins now.
Hi, my name is Miranda.
I help make sure that people with cognitive disabilities have equal access to our performances and events.
We are excited to share with you two pieces of art that we commissioned as part of our series on ADA in the Arts.
Heidi Latsky Dance is the first group performing tonight. We've partnered with them for many years at Lincoln Center.
We respect her work.
This is a piece of art called "SOLO FLIGHT ADA 30."
This exhibit features 15 artists, both disabled and nondisabled, who are sharing their experience of isolation with us.
This means that you can have a good time or experience.
This next video is about making art accessible for people with cognitive disabilities.
This event is being held in collaboration with Queens Theater. It is part of the Queens Theater for All Initiative, which is designed to make theater accessible for everyone.
This is a virtual performance of "Death Bites" written by Makena Metz. The performance is written and directed by a team of disabled artists.
We hope you have a good time.
My name is Rebecca Cokely and I work at the Center for American Progress. I help people with disabilities get the justice they deserve.
Jackson Santi is a poet and spoken word artist who is new to the scene in Chicago.
The poet has a great future ahead of him.
This is Jackson Santi. He is performing his original work, "Photosynthesis and Other Life Lessons".
to God.Singing is a way to connect with God.
Hello, everyone, and welcome to the first-ever Disability Unite Festival. This is a place where we can all come together and celebrate everything that makes us unique. We hope you enjoy your time here and please feel free to explore everything the festival has to offer. Thank you for being here and we hope you have a great time!
The Disability Unite Festival is a yearly event that celebrates the Americans with Disabilities Act. It is put on by the Disability Community Consortium Project Access for All and the New York City Mayor's Office for People With Disabilities.
Project Access for All is a community consortium made up of many different people and organizations.
This is a festival for our community, created by our community.
This couldn't have happened without the leadership of New York City's Commissioner, Victor Calise.
He has assembled an excellent team.
This group is communicating well via weekly phone calls hosted by Jonathan Novick. They are seeing New York City through the coronavirus pandemic.
The disability community is working together and getting to know each other better.
We can see the national network of Mayor's Offices for People With Disabilities working together to help each other during these difficult times.
This crisis has had a positive outcome.
We have seen a lot of growth in the number of people with disabilities who are involved in their communities and working with others to improve things.
This is the 30th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and also the 50th anniversary of Disabled in Action.
We are excited to have Jean Ryan, the president of the National Council on Disability, virtually cut the ribbon and start off our first Disability Unite Festival.
Disabled in Action (DIA) is a civil rights organization committed to ending discrimination against people with disabilities. DIA fights to eliminate the barriers that prevent us from enjoying full equality in American society.
Jean, do you want to say something?
Thank you for your question.
We have been fighting for our rights for 50 years. We have been meeting, emailing, suing, and protesting. Some of us have even been arrested.
You said, Matt, that Commissioner Calise is important in our community.
I would like to point out that he has been appointed to the Metropolitan Transit Authority Board, which is also known as the MTA.
Community members lobbied for Commissioner Calise to get the appointment because of her experience and knowledge.
It is important to always make sure that we have a seat the table, and we have to cultivate our leadership to have people as capable as Commissioner Calise to push forward for appointments.
I'm excited about Disability Unite.
The support of thousands of disabled people and non-disabled allies gives us power.
I completely agree with you, Jean.
We can create the change we need together.
We hope you enjoy the Disability Unite Festival and that you will join us in working to make our communities more inclusive for everyone, including people with disabilities.
Hi, my name is Chelsie.
I'm the founder of the Rollettes wheelchair dance team.
Our team is made up of women with disabilities who are incredible and do not let their disability define them.
Our mission is to help women with disabilities to improve their lives through dance.
We have been featured on a lot of popular platforms!
We are the Rollettes, and you can find out more about us by visiting our website at RollettesDance.com. You can also follow us on all social media channels to stay up-to-date on everything we're doing.
We're excited to be part of Disability Unite's Virtual Festival.
The Rollettes Dance Team is here to entertain you. They are a group of professional dancers who perform in wheelchairs.
Six people, including myself, are performing a song called "We Can Together."
Equality between genders is not just a female issue, it is something that concerns everyone.
It's important for our society and economy.
Hiring people with disabilities is not only the right thing to do from a standpoint of equality, but it also makes good business sense and can help a company be more successful.
Equality is coming, but it will take more than 100 years to have gender parity in the C-suite and more than 257 years to close the gender pay gap.
We cannot wait for everyone to have equality, access, and inclusion before we push forward our message.
We will continue to fight for equality for people with disabilities, people of color, and LGBTQ people.
We have an impact when we work together.
The Female Quotient helps organizations improve their ROE (Return On Equality). This happens when organizations become a catalyst for change and help close the gender gap.
We are working to improve equality in the workplace and in media. We are finding ways to make changes, measuring progress, and helping companies become better at promoting equality.
We help business leaders promote equality by providing research, tools, and experiences. We also publish The Modern Guide to Equality, which is a playbook for activating change.
We're excited to team up with Disability Unite and other disability rights advocates.
