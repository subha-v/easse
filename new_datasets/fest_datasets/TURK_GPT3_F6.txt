Hello, everyone.
I am actor advocate Andy Arias.
I'm happy it's ADA 30.
I want to give a shout out to disabilityunite.org.
Thank you for putting on such an amazing event.
Thank you for inviting me to do this.
It's almost November, which means it's time to go out and vote.
Your choices and voices always matter.
It's important for everyone to vote in November.
Be sure to know where your polling place is located.
There are absentee ballot options available, and there may be other options available depending on what situation we find ourselves in.
We, the people, should have an equal say.
In November, please remember to go out and vote.
If I don't say anything, will you notice me?
We present The Movement.
This course is for people who need a refresher.
We all have our own cars, right?
Cars, trucks, bicycles, wheelchairs, motorized wheelchairs, canes, and crutches are all types of transportation.
We should all be aware of the things around us and adjust accordingly so that we can all get to where we're going.
I said this is a unique time and space.
Thank you for choosing 4 Wheel City.
I'm going to 4 Wheel City.
Thank you for spending the evening with us.
My name is Gha'il Rhodes Benjamin. I told you my name before.
I am an ally of disabled people.
We all share the same air.
You and I share the same space.
We have more in common than we realize.
I hope you have a wonderful summer.
Keep yourself safe.
I love you.
Thank you for joining us.
I will see you next time.
Good evening, and welcome to the Disability Unite Festival.
My name is Gha'il Rhodes Benjamin.
I'm happy to be here with you this evening.
We have all been waiting for this moment.
The moment is titled "It Just Had to be Said".
In this next segment, the artists will protest 2020. They will talk about the us, the we, the they, the fear, the outrage, the defiance, and how all of this is redefining our identities.
The next few artists tell it like it is.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about myself.
My name is Gha'il Rhodes Benjamin and I am a performance spoken-word artist.
I wrote and performed this piece, which is called Global Libations.
This memorial is for the heroes and sheroes who are no longer with us. They have left behind husbands, wives, children, grandparents, and elders.
Global Libations is a website.
Zazel O'Garra is the founder and artistic director of ZCO Dance Project.
She is a powerful force in the artistic industry.
There's nothing that can slow her down or pull her back.
I can do anything!
She is amazing.
My dancers defy gravity.
I move through space and time effortlessly.
It seems like they can't stop.
I am determined to succeed no matter what the odds are.
In this new piece, titled "We the People", I will show you what I'm talking about.
Put your hands up.
It's time to get ready.
ZCO Dance Project is performing right now.
Go.
Hi, it's me, Andrea.
Hi, this is Disability Night.
Thanks for coming today.
We are honored to have you.
I'm known as the seated nurse.
Can you tell us a little bit about yourself and your disability?
I am the nurse who is sitting down.
I'm the first registered nurse in New York City to graduate from nursing school and be a wheelchair user at the same time. I have transverse myelitis.
I was diagnosed with a cognitive disability when I was five years old and stopped walking when I was 12.
I am so happy!
I think you're very gifted and talented.
I've known you for a while.
I was also Miss Wheelchair New York.
Why did you choose to become a nurse?
I wanted to be a nurse.
We had spoken about representation a long time ago, what does that mean to us?
I didn't see nurses that look like me-- not as a woman, not as a woman of color, but as a woman with a disability.
I wanted to help people.
I wanted to be a lawyer before that.
I wanted to get towards where I really wanted to be in life, so I thought about giving back and being of service to someone else.
Medical school teaches you how to treat a disease process.
I didn't want to treat someone as if they were sick.
Nursing was the perfect fit for me because I wanted to treat them as a person.
Do you have any benefits as a nurse in a wheelchair when meeting patients?
I agree.
When you are in a seated position or have a disability, you are bringing a perspective that somebody might not have, right?
We know that people often say that having a disability is like a "death sentence," but that's not true.
When you come into nursing and you have your disability, that person knows that life goes on outside of the four walls of a hospital or outside the four walls of a clinic.
When you give them that new lease on life, you're also giving them hope.
From my perspective, things look different.
We're innovators and there's a perk to that.
I already know how to think 20 steps ahead.
Yes, I agree.
I was recently on the front lines of the COVID-19 crisis.
Can you tell us about that and your experiences?
Yeah, COVID in New York hit everyone really hard.
We will never stop journey to help those who are sick and lost loved ones.
Right? They say it's the new normal.
I don't want this to be normal.
We don't want to be stuck inside.
We don't want our loved ones to be sick.
So, luckily, as we with disabilities already understand the scope of being excluded, possibly not leaving our homes, being afraid for going in and out of hospitals or clinics, we understand this life a little bit more, right?
I can adapt to it better than most people.
We know what this is like.
Tell us your stories.
We are all in this together, so let's help each other out.
Yes, that is correct.
I would tell the community to stay home as much as possible.
Since I know a lot of people have been isolated, which is maybe not normal from our normal routines or separate from our normal routines, I wanted to make a video.
But what advice can you give me to help maintain a healthy lifestyle?
It's best to avoid being in big crowds right now.
Wear a mask if you have to be out.
Wash your hands.
I'm telling you, don't miss appointments, OK?
When you stay away from clinics and hospitals, you are only jeopardizing your health.
Make sure that you go to your physicians and get the treatments that you need.
We want to make sure that we're keeping ourselves healthy.
We need to see our doctors to do that.
I'm a nurse that has been in all of these buildings and has been at the bedside at the peak of COVID. They're putting in every precaution to make sure that we are staying healthy when we do enter into those settings.
I hope you're taking care of yourselves.
Go outside.
Call me.
You're not alone through all of this.
Yes.
If you want to be a nurse or work in the health care industry, my advice is to __________.
I imagine it wasn't an easy road for you to be understood and accepted into this community.
It was a hard fight.
I'm still a professional who needs to understand that disability does not equal inability, right?
I can still help you even though I'm sitting down.
I think that even people within our community who have disabilities try to put the same biases on themselves. Like, oh, I can't do something because that's for someone who doesn't have a disability, or how would I be able to lift something?
How can you do something?
We do things differently.
As someone with different abilities, we have to be innovative in how we come up to a solution.
You may sometimes need help from others, or you may be able to do it by yourself.
Everyone's perception of us does not define us.
You get to choose how you want to enter this field and what your story will be.
I am the only one that gets to decide that.
I like that.
Where do you think Andrea will be in 10 years?
I am studying a master's in nursing education and hope to become a doctorate of nursing practice in a few years.
I want to help our community.
It's important that we have people in healthcare that understand what it's like to have a disability, so that they can provide better care.
I want to be able to treat and understand, not just treat and not understand.
I like that.
Thank you, Andrea, for joining us at Disability Unite today.
I am a visionary, in my words, I am an educator, and I am a inspiration to so many people.
I'm inspired by you every day and you're a milestone in the community that is helping to push our community forward.
Thank you for being with us today. We wish you the best of luck and we'll definitely be following you.
Thank you, Corey.
Thank you all.
I will take care.
Bye.
I'm up next!
Full Radius Dance is a professional dance company based in Atlanta. It is made up of dancers with and without physical disabilities.
The company strongly illustrates the organization's belief that inclusion in the performing arts, and in particular dance, is capable of creating power, passion, and innovation.
We maintain a busy performance schedule in Atlanta, as well as regionally, nationally, and internationally.
The company will be performing Re-Emerge, which is the first part of a three-part series called Return.
Full Radius Dance created Re-Emerge for the camera as a response to the self-quarantining necessary due to COVID-19.
How will we come out of this?
The dancers choreographed Re-Emerge under the artistic direction of Douglas Scott.
You can find us online at www.fullradiusdance.org. Our Twitter and Instagram are @FullRadiusDance.
Hi, I'm Jeff Tweedy from Wilco, and I'm here to introduce the next performer, Gaelynn Lea.
A few years ago, we met each other at a festival in Montana.
I felt like I had known Gaelynn my whole life when I met her, even though we were just friends.
She has opened for Wilco.
I won a Tiny Desk Concert in 2016, and after that, I hit the road with my husband.
I do a show every Sunday on YouTube.
I have a lot of energy to make the world a better place.
I love her.
I can't wait to see her perform.
Hello, my name is _____.
I am Justin Cooper. I help plan the Chicago Disability Pride Parade.
I am honored to be a part of this virtual festival.
I'm thankful for Disability Unite for giving me an opportunity to speak to you all.
We normally celebrate Disability Pride Month by going to various parades and events throughout the country.
We've all had to change our strategies on how we showcase our events because of COVID.
We made a video with members of our committee sharing our thoughts on what our disability pride parade and also the 30th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act means to us.
During our meeting about the video process, members of Disability Unite joined us.
We talked about our plans for the parade and their plans for today's virtual festival.
We talked about what it would mean to our communities if we collaborated together.
I worked with many disability organizations throughout the country.
We, as people with disabilities who take pride in being who we are, take pride in showing solidarity with each other, and take pride in supporting one another during these times of a pandemic.
We've always been there for each other, making sure we have what we need to live our lives and be a part of the community.
We should continue to love, fight, and support each other during these times.
It's time for us to put together disability pride parades and disability festivals to work together and create awareness. We need to continue doing this for years to come.
I want to thank you for giving me this time.
I want to thank Matt and Elizabeth Axel for reaching out to this Chicago Disability Pride Parade Committee and to Disability Unite.
I look forward to working with you all in the future.
Thank you for letting me do this.
I hope this festival is very good today.
Let's all have a good time and celebrate disability pride.
Thank you.
Hey, friends.Hey, friends.
It's Lachi.
We are here to celebrate our community and how awesome each and every one of us are.
The disability community has different types of people with different types of disabilities.
I'm a triple threat. I can act, sing, and write.
I'm a beautiful woman.
We're all different.
We're creative and we love it.
We've had regulation for 30 years and we're grateful for it. Here's to 30 more years.
I am Laura Benanti and I am happy to introduce Evan Ruggiero to you.
I'm from New Jersey just like Evan!
I started tapping when I was 5 years old. When I was a sophomore in college, I was diagnosed with a very rare form of cancer.
I had to have nine surgeries in six months and then I had to make the decision to amputate my leg.
After receiving his peg leg, he was tapping again.
I know him to be a very courageous and inspirational person.
It's great that he's still performing for people like Ellen DeGeneres and the Bidens.
That's amazing!
He was nominated for the Chita Rivera Dance Award.
He's an amazing person.
He's also very nice, and that's important.
I'm glad to be here. Here I am.
I'm Thomas Ellenson, and I'm really pleased to introduce Ryan Niemiller. He's a really funny guy and is also a trailblazer for me and other disabled actors and comics.
I wrote my own material because I knew that if I didn't, people wouldn't hire me.
I don't consider myself a disabled actor or comedian, like Ryan.
Disability is part of my life.
My humor does not come from just one source.
I read that the power of laughter saved Ryan.
Kids can be cruel if you're different from them. In my case, I was teased because I didn't talk like everyone else.
When bullies make fun of you, using wit right away is a great tool.
I'm known as the Cripple Threat-- the Power of Humor.
I find joy in laughter because it unites people.
I'm happy to introduce Cripple Threat Ryan Niemiller from America's Got Talent.
Thank you, everyone.
Hello, my name is ________.
My name is Victor Calise and I am the Commissioner of the Mayor's Office for People With Disabilities.
Welcome, everyone, to the first ever Disability Unite Festival.
We are excited to present a program of music, dance, art, discussion, gaming, and more.
I'd like to start by thanking the members of the Disability Community Consortium Project, who have worked to make this event possible.
We've organized an incredible celebration during a difficult time with our community partners around the country.
We are in a period of upheaval, change, challenge and sadness.
I've seen our community rise up to overcome.
We are stronger, work, and succeed together.
This event marks the 30th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act. This act is an important legislation that was passed 30 years ago that states all people are equal and should have equal opportunities.
We also celebrate the 50th anniversary of Disabled in Action, a civil rights organization.
Today, we share gratitude to the leaders of DIA, who orchestrated protests, had sit-ins, even chained themselves to buses in order for us to have the disability accommodations that we have today.
We also recognize our nation's communities of color and LGBTQ community. These groups support each other, help each other, and make each other strong.
The disability rights movement is stronger because of other civil rights movements. We owe them gratitude and should continue to support them.
We have seen great improvements for people with disabilities since ADA was passed.
We have many things to celebrate in July, but we also know that we need to continue fighting for what we believe in.
The Disability Unite Festival is a time for us to celebrate our community, our individuality, and the parts of ourselves that make us unique and amazing.
This is a platform to further advance equity and inclusion for everyone.
A community is not defined by the distance between its members.
We all have community inside of us.
It shows itself in the way we speak, act, love, and advocate for ourselves, our families, our friends, and our neighbors.
We are a strong community.
We make change happen.
Now enjoy the festival. Next year we will be together in person.
I'm proud to celebrate Disability Pride Month.
I am delighted to welcome you to this part of the show.
We will highlight artists from different genres at different stages of their careers.
The Americans with Disabilities Act is a law that provides equal rights for disabled people.
I want to make art.
It guarantees our access to do so.
We see a lot of different artists and arts groups today because art is important to us.
The ADA is not enough.
Disability artistry helps us see access as a series of practices, rather than regulations.
This is our future. It begins now.
I'm Miranda Hoffner.
I help make Lincoln Center's performances accessible for everyone.
I'm so delighted to share with you two pieces that we commissioned as part of our ADA in the Arts series.
The first performance is from Heidi Latsky Dance, a partner that we've worked with for many years.
I respect her work.
It is a piece called SOLO FLIGHT.
This experience includes 15 artists, disabled and nondisabled.,
I hope you enjoy.
The following piece is part of Lincoln Center's ADA in the Arts Video Series.
I am collaborating with Queens Theater and featuring Queens Theater for All Initiative.
This is a virtual reading of "Death Bites," written by Makena Metz.
We hope you will have a good time.
My name is Rebecca Cokely, and I'm the director of the Disability Justice Initiative at the Center for American Progress.
I am a poet and spoken word artist who is just beginning my career.
When you hear his poem, you will understand that he has a great future ahead of him.
I introduce Jackson Santi who will perform his original work, "Photosynthesis and Other Life Lessons".
I'm Ricky McKinnie from the Blind Boys of Alabama, and singing brings us close.
Welcome to the first-ever Disability Unite Festival. This is the intersection of everything about us with us.
The Disability Unite Festival began as a project of the Disability Community Consortium Project Access for All and the New York City Mayor's Office for People With Disabilities.
Project Access for All is a community consortium made up of many different people and organizations.
This festival is for and by our community.
I would like to thank Commissioner Victor Calise for his leadership in making this event possible.
I put together an incredible team.
I see New York City through the coronavirus pandemic, and with weekly phone calls hosted by Jonathan Novick, we have outstanding communication.
The disability community got to know each other better and worked together.
We can see the national network of Mayor's Offices for People With Disabilities helping each other during these difficult times.
This crisis has a positive outcome.
We have seen many people with disabilities joining our community and partnering with us from all around the world.
This is both the 30th anniversary of the ADA and the 50th anniversary of Disabled in Action.
We are very honored to have Jean Ryan, the president of the National Down Syndrome Society, here to do the virtual ribbon cutting and start off the first Disability Unite Festival.
Disabled in Action (DIA) is a civil rights organization that fights to end discrimination against all people with disabilities. DIA works to eliminate the barriers that prevent us from enjoying full equality in American society.
Would you like to say a few words, Jean?
I appreciate your help.
We have had 50 years of trying to fix the problem.
I remarked to Matt about Commissioner Calise's role in our community.
I would like to talk about his appointment to the Metropolitan Transit Authority Board, which is also called the MTA.
I have the experience and know-how and the community lobbied together to get this appointment to happen.
It is important to always have a seat at the table and to cultivate our leadership to have people as capable as Commissioner Calise to push forward for appointments.
I am excited about Disability Unite.
Our ability to have the support of thousands of disabled people and non-disabled allies gives us power.
I agree with you, Jean.
We can create the change we need.
We hope you have a great time at the Disability Unite Festival. Join us in creativity, fun, friendship, and taking action to make our communities a place of equality, access, and inclusion for all, including people with disabilities.

Gender equality is not just a female issue.
It's important for social and economic reasons.
Employing people with disabilities is not only about equality, but also good business sense that can lead to a company's success.
We can't just wait more than 100 years to realize gender parity in the C-suite and more than 257 years to close the gender pay gap.
We cannot wait for equality, access, and inclusion for all as we push forward our message.
We will push forward the message of equity for people with disabilities, communities of color, and LGBTQ communities.
We have an impact when we work together.
The Female Quotient helps organizations achieve ROE, Return On Equality.
We are committed to advancing equality in the workplace and in media. We are working to create change through our solutions and measurements for accountability. We also want to help companies become equality fit.
We promote equality by providing research and tools to business leaders and publishing The Modern Guide to Equality, a playbook for activating change.
We look forward to working with Disability Unite and the disability community.
