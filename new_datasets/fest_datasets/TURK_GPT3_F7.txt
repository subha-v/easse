Hello, everyone!
Celebrate ADA 30!
The event was awesome, thank you.
Thank you Corey and Elizabeth for having me.
It is almost November, so let's go out and vote.
Your choices and voices are important.
Your voice needs to be heard in November, no matter your beliefs.
Find out where you can vote.
You can vote by absentee ballot. More options may be available.
People with disabilities are the largest population and need to have equal voices and choices.
Remember to vote in November.
Do you notice me if I don't speak up?
This course helps you remember things.
Are we all in different cars?
Cars, trucks, bicycles, wheelchairs, motorized wheelchairs, canes, and crutches.
Pay attention and be kind so we can all reach our goals.
This is a special time and place.
Thank you from 4 Wheel City.
4 Wheel City is here.
Thank you for joining us this evening.
My name is Gha'il Rhodes Benjamin.
I support disabled people.
We share the same air.
Maya Angelou said we all have a lot in common.
Have a great summer!
Be careful.
We care about you.
Thank you for joining us.
Bye for now.
Hello, everyone! We are here for the Disability Unite Festival.
My name is Gha'il Benjamin.
I'm glad to be here with you.
We are all excited for this moment.
It's called "It Just Had to be Said".
In this next segment, artists are telling what needs to be said in protest of 2020. We are all redefining our identities.
These artists will tell it to you like it is.
Let me tell you about me.
My name is Gha'il Rhodes Benjamin, I am a performance spoken-word artist.
I wrote and performed this piece, it is called Global Libations.
This memorial honors those who have passed away, the heroes and sheroes who are not here anymore. They left behind family such as husbands, wives, children and grandparents.
Global Libations is here.
Zazel O'Garra is a powerful leader. She is the founder and artistic director of ZCO Dance Project.
She is very talented in art.
Nothing can stop her.
Zazel will not be stopped.
She is amazing.
Her dancers are amazing.
They move easily in space and time.
They can't stop.
They are very determined and do not give up.
You can see what I'm talking about in the new piece "We the People" choreographed by Wendy Powell.
Raise your hands.
Be prepared.
ZCO Dance Project is here.
Good luck, ZCO.
Hello, Andrea.
Welcome to Disability Night.
Thank you for joining us today.
We are very happy you are here.
People call me the seated nurse.
Can you tell us about your background and disability?
I am the nurse sitting here.
I am the first registered nurse in NYC who has transverse myelitis and uses a wheelchair.
I was diagnosed when I was five and I stopped walking when I was 12.
That's great!
You have a lot of gifts and talents.
We've been friends for a while.
You were also Miss Wheelchair New York.
Why did you choose to be a nurse?
I didn't always want to be a nurse.
We talked about representation a while ago, right?
I could not find nurses like me who had a disability.
I want to be a doctor.
Before this, I wanted to be a lawyer.
I wanted to help others, so I thought about giving back.
Medical school teaches us how diseases work in a person's body.
I did not want to treat someone badly.
I wanted to help people, so I chose nursing.
Do you think being in a wheelchair gives you an advantage when talking to patients as a nurse?
I totally agree.
Having a disability can give you a unique perspective.
People often say that disability is like a "death sentence," right?
Nursing helps people with disabilities show that life keeps going even outside of hospitals and clinics.
You're giving people with disabilities hope and a new life.
This is a different view.
We're innovators, which means we get a bonus.
We can think ahead.
Yes, that's right.
You helped during the COVID-19 crisis.
Can you tell us about your experiences?
COVID hit New York like a tornado.
Many people have died, many people are sick, many people are recovering and this journey will not end soon.
They say this is the new normal, right?
We want to be free.
We don't want our loved ones to be sick from COVID.
We with disabilities understand the fear of exclusion, not being able to leave our homes, and fear of going in and out of hospitals or clinics.
We can adjust to it better than most people.
We know what this is like, let's do something about it.
Tell us your stories.
Help each other, we need to stay strong.
That's right.
What advice would you give us during the pandemic?
Many people have been isolated due to the changes in their routines.
What advice can you give to help them stay healthy?
Stay away from large groups of people.
Remember to wash your hands.
Remember to go to all your appointments.
Don't stay away from clinics and hospitals, it can be bad for your health.
Remember to go to your doctor and get the care you need.
We want to stay healthy.
We need to talk to our doctors to do that.
I am a nurse and I have seen all the safety precautions to make sure we stay healthy when we go into buildings.
Remember to take care of yourselves.
Go outside.
Call a friend now.
You are not alone.
Yes.
What advice do you have for someone younger who wants to work in health care?
It was hard for you to be accepted and understood in that community.
It was a difficult challenge.
Professionals should remember that having a disability does not mean someone is unable.
I can help you in any way even though I'm sitting down.
We should not limit ourselves because of our disability. We can do anything.
How can you do something?
We do things in our own way.
We can be creative in how we find solutions, no matter what kind of disabilities we have.
Sometimes you need help, and sometimes you can do it alone.
Remember, other people's opinions of us do not define us.
You can decide what your story is and how you join this field.
Only you get to decide that.
That is great.
Where will Andrea be in 10 years?
I am studying a master's in nursing education with the plan to get a doctorate of nursing practice in the next few years.
I want to help our community.
It is important to have health care workers that understand disabilities and can help treat them.
Treat people with understanding.
That is so nice.
Thank you Andrea Dalzell for joining us at Disability Unite.
Thank you for helping our community move forward. You inspire us every day.
We wish you luck and will follow you.
Thank you, Corey.
Thank you, everyone.
Be safe.
Goodbye.

Hi, I'm Jeff Tweedy from Wilco. Gaelynn Lea will be performing next.
We met a few years ago at a festival in Montana.
I felt like Gaelynn was my friend or family the moment I met them.
She has performed before Wilco.
She won a Tiny Desk Concert in 2016 and went on tour with her husband.
She does a show on YouTube every Sunday, she has been in 45 states and nine countries.
She has a lot of energy to make the world better.
I really care about her.
I am excited for you to watch her perform.
Hi, everyone!
My name is Justin Cooper. I help with the Chicago Disability Pride Parade.
I am proud to be part of this virtual festival.
During Disability Pride Month, we show our disability pride at parades and events.
COVID has changed how we show our events.
In Chicago, we made a video with members of our committee talking about what the Disability Pride Parade and the 30th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act mean to them.
Disability Unite joined us during a meeting about the video process.
We talked about our parade plans and their festival plans.
We talked about how we could work together to help our disability communities.
I worked with disability organizations from Chicago, New York, and across the US.
We, people with disabilities, take pride in being ourselves, showing solidarity, and supporting each other during this pandemic.
We have been helping each other and providing resources to help us live our lives and be part of the community.
We must love, fight, and support each other.
Let's organize disability pride parades and festivals to increase awareness and keep going for many years.
Thank you for giving me this time.
I want to thank Matt and Elizabeth Axel for helping the Chicago Disability Pride Parade Committee and Disability Unite.
The committee is excited to work with you soon.
Thank you for giving me this opportunity.
I hope everyone has a great time today.
Let's celebrate disability pride!
Thank you very much.
Hello everyone.
My name is Lachi.
We are here to celebrate our community and how great everyone is.
Disability is part of many identities.
I can do acting, singing, and writing.
I am a black, blind woman and I am beautiful.
We are all different.
We are creative and full of love.
We are thankful for the regulations that have supported us for 30 years. Here's to 30 more years!
I'm Laura Benanti. It's my honor to introduce Evan Ruggiero.
Evan is from New Jersey, we are Jersey for life!
He began tapping at age 5 and was diagnosed with an unusual type of cancer when he was a sophomore at Montclair State University.
He had nine surgeries and decided to amputate his leg.
He had surgery, got his peg leg, and two days later he was tapping again.
He is very brave and inspiring.
He is amazing and he has performed for Ellen DeGeneres, the Bidens, and the Oscars.
Wow!
He was nominated for the Drama Desk and Chita Rivera Dance Awards.
He is amazing.
He is very kind and that is important.
Thank you for inviting me. Here he is.
Hi, I'm Thomas Ellenson. I'm glad to introduce Ryan Niemiller. He is funny and he helps disabled actors and comics.
I wrote my own material because I knew if I didn't, people might not give me a chance.
I am not a disabled actor or comedian, like Ryan.
Disability is not my whole life.
My humor is not limited, it can come from many sources.
Ryan said that laughter saved him.
Sometimes kids can be mean if you don't look like them or speak like them.
Using wit can help when bullies make fun.
Ryan is called Cripple Threat-- the Power of Humor.
Ryan says that laughter unites people and brings joy to life, including mine.
I'm excited to introduce Cripple Threat Ryan Niemiller from America's Got Talent.
Thank you all.
Hi everyone!
I'm Victor Calise, I work for the Mayor's Office for People With Disabilities.
Welcome to the Disability Unite Festival!
We have an exciting program with music, dance, art, discussion, gaming and more.
Thank you to members of the Mayor's Office for People With Disabilities and the Disability Community Consortium Project, Access For All, for helping make this event possible.
We worked with partners to have a great celebration during a tough time.
Our country is facing difficult times.
I have seen our community succeed.
We are better when we work together.
Today, we celebrate 30 years since the Americans with Disabilities Act was passed. This law ensures that everyone has equal access and opportunity.
Today we celebrate 50 years of Disabled in Action, DIA, a civil rights organization from New York City.
We appreciate the leaders of DIA who fought for disability accommodations.
We thank our nation's communities of color, LGBTQ community, and civil rights movements for supporting each other.
The disability rights movement is strong because of civil rights movements, so we must thank them and keep supporting them.
ADA made great progress for disability rights.
This July is a time to celebrate, but we still need to keep advocating.
The Disability Unite Festival is a time to celebrate our community and our individuality.
This is a platform to help everyone be treated equally.
We are still a community even though we are apart.
We all have community inside us.
We show it in how we speak, act, love and advocate for ourselves, our families, friends and neighbors.
Together, we are strong.
We can make change happen. We have made progress in fighting for disability rights, and we will keep fighting until everyone has the same access and opportunity.
Have fun at the festival. I hope to see you all in person next year.
Celebrate Disability Pride Month!
We will be showing art from many types of artists, no matter their experience.
The ADA helps us with our work.
Disabled people may want to make art.
It helps us access what we need.
That's why there are lots of artists and art groups.
We need more than the ADA.
Disability artistry helps us think of access as something we do, not just rules we follow.
Our future starts now.
My name is Miranda Hoffner. Hi!
I help people with disabilities access Lincoln Center's performances.
We commissioned two pieces for our ADA in the Arts series and I'm excited to share them.
Heidi Latsky Dance is our partner at Lincoln Center. We've worked together for many years.
We respect her work very much.
SOLO FLIGHT ADA 30 is the name of this piece.
15 artists, both disabled and not, are sharing their experience in isolation with us.
Have fun!
This part is from Lincoln Center's ADA in the Arts Video Series.
Queens Theater and the Queens Theater for All Initiative are working together.
We are watching a virtual reading of "Death Bites", written by Makena Metz and performed by disabled artists.
We hope you like it.
I'm Rebecca Cokely. I work at the Center for American Progress leading the Disability Justice Initiative.

Welcome to the Disability Unite Festival, a celebration of disability.
The Disability Unite Festival was created by Project Access for All and the Mayor's Office for People With Disabilities to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act.
Project Access for All is a group of people and organizations working together to help the community.
This festival is for and by our community.
Victor Calise, New York City's Commissioner, made this happen.
His team is amazing.
Jonathan Novick hosts weekly phone calls to help us through the coronavirus pandemic in New York City.
The disability community got to know each other better and worked together.
We can see the Mayor's Offices for People With Disabilities working together to help each other during this hard time.
This crisis has a good result.
Disability groups from many places are growing quickly and working together.
This year is special - it's the 30th anniversary of the ADA and the 50th anniversary of Disabled in Action.
We are honored to have Jean Ryan, the president of disabilityunite.org, here for the virtual ribbon cutting of the Disability Unite Festival.
DIA (Disabled in Action) works to end discrimination against people with disabilities. They want us to have the same rights as everyone else in America.
Jean, do you want to say something?
Thank you very much.
We have spent 50 years fighting for disability rights through meetings, emails, lawsuits and sit-ins, some of us have been arrested.
Matt, you mentioned Commissioner Calise's role in our community.
I want to tell you about his appointment to the MTA Board.
Commissioner Calise has the experience and the community worked together to get this appointment.
We need to make sure we have a seat at the table and find strong leaders like Commissioner Calise to help us move forward.
I am happy about Disability Unite.
DIA is supported by many disabled people and allies, which gives us strength.
I agree, Jean.
We can create the change we need together.
Have fun at the Disability Unite Festival, and let's work together to make communities accessible for everyone.

Gender equality is for all genders.
It is important for society and the economy.
Hiring people with disabilities is good for business.
We need to work to end gender inequality now and close the gender pay gap.
We must act now for equality, access, and inclusion for all.
We will work for equality for people with disabilities, people of color, and LGBTQ communities.
The Female Quotient helps organizations create change and get a good return.
We are making workplaces and media more equal by finding solutions, measuring progress, and helping companies do better.
We help business leaders create equality and we published The Modern Guide to Equality, a guidebook for making change.
We are excited to work with Disability Unite and the disability community together.
