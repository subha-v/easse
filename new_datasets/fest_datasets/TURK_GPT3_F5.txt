Hi everyone!
I'm actor advocate Andy Arias.
Celebrate ADA 30 with us!
I'd like to give a special mention to disabilityunite.org.
You did a great job organizing the event.
I was invited by Corey and Elizabeth to do this.
It's almost November, which means it's time for us to go vote!
Your decisions and thoughts are important now.
You should use your voice to vote in November.
You need to find out where you can vote.
I can vote by absentee ballot, and there may be other voting options depending on what happens.
We are the largest population on the planet and it is important that we all have the same rights and freedom to make our own choices.
Remember to vote in November.
Would you notice me if I didn't say anything?
I'm presenting The Movement at 4 Wheel City.
You need to take this course again to refresh your skills.
Do we all travel in different cars?
You may need a car, truck, bicycle, wheelchair, motorized wheelchair, cane, or crutch.
Please be aware of others so we can all reach our destination.
This is a very special time and place.
We want to thank you.
You need to do the following operations to simplify this for people with cognitive disabilities.
I really appreciate you coming over and spending the evening with us.
I am Gha'il Rhodes Benjamin.
I support disabled people.
You and I both breathe the same air.
You and I are in the same place.
I and my fellow humans have a lot in common.
I wish you a wonderful summer.
To keep yourself safe, follow safety guidelines.
I care about you.
We appreciate you coming.
I'll see you soon.
Welcome! I'm so glad you are here for the Disability Unite Festival.
I'm Gha'il Rhodes Benjamin.
I'm delighted to be with you tonight.
We have been waiting for this moment.
I need to say something important.
I, along with other artists, am speaking out about the events of 2020. We are expressing our anger, fear, and defiance. We are all redefining who we are.
We bring it to you and tell it like it is.
I want to tell you about me.
Hi, I'm Gha'il Rhodes Benjamin and I'm a spoken-word artist.
I wrote and performed a song called Global Libations.
We remember those who are no longer with us - the heroes and sheroes who have left husbands, wives, children, grandparents, and elders behind.
You need to do certain things to make this easier for people with cognitive disabilities. To help people with cognitive disabilities, you should do the following: simplify, rephrase, remove information, add information, and explain any implied knowledge.
I'm a force to be reckoned with.
I'm an influential artist.
I'm unstoppable; nothing can hold me back.
You won't be able to stop Zazel.
I am powerful.
My dancers can move in ways that seem to break the laws of gravity.
I move easily through space and time.
I can't seem to stop.
I am determined to succeed no matter what.
I'm talking about what you'll get to see in the new piece, called "We the People", choreographed by Wendy Powell.
Raise your hands.
Prepare yourself.
Now, the ZCO Dance Project is here for you.
You should go, ZCO.
Hi, it's me Andrea.
Hello! You're here for Disability Night.
I really appreciate you visiting me today.
We're delighted to have you here.
I am known as the seated nurse.
Tell us about yourself and your disability.
I am the nurse who is sitting.
I'm the first registered nurse in New York City who uses a wheelchair and has transverse myelitis. I graduated from nursing school.
When I was five, I was diagnosed with a disability. By the time I was 12, I could no longer walk.
You can do this by performing some operations, like getting closer to the reader, changing words, deleting or adding information, and making things more clear.
You have a lot of gifts and talents.
I've been friends with you for a while.
I was recently crowned Miss Wheelchair New York.
Why did you decide to become a nurse?
I used to have a different career goal.
We talked about representation before, didn't we?
I couldn't find any nurses that looked like me; a woman with a disability and a woman of color.
I want to be a doctor.
Before this, I wanted to be a lawyer.
I wanted to help someone else, so I thought about how I could give back.
I'm learning in medical school how to treat diseases and how they affect people's bodies.
I wanted to treat them with respect.
I wanted to help people so I decided to become a nurse.
As a nurse, do you think being able to relate to people in the patient setting has any benefits?
I agree completely.
If you have a disability or if you are sitting down, you can offer a unique perspective.
Disability is sometimes seen as a “death sentence.”
When I became a nurse, I was already living with a disability, but I still could give care to others in hospital and clinic settings.
I'm giving people with disabilities hope that they cannot get from non-disabled doctors or nurses.
I see things in a new way.
We're innovators and that means there's a perk for us.
I can anticipate what will happen 20 steps in advance.
You got it!
I was recently part of the group helping to fight COVID-19.
Could you share your experiences with us?
I'm sure you know that COVID had a big impact on New York.
I may have to keep dealing with the loss of lives, sickness, and people recovering from this illness for a long time.
I need to do this new normal thing.
I don't want this to be the norm.
We don't want to stay inside.
I don't want my loved ones to get sick or experience the effects of COVID.
I understand the feeling of being excluded and not wanting to leave the house due to having a disability. I know what it's like to be scared of going to hospitals or clinics.
I can adjust to it better than most people.
We understand this situation.
Tell us your story.
I need your help to get through this, let's do it together.
You need to do these things.
What tips can I use to stay safe during the pandemic?
I understand that many of us have been living differently lately since we are not able to do the same activities we normally do.
What tips can I use to stay healthy?
I should stay away from large groups of people.
You should wear a mask if you must go outside.
I need to wash my hands.
Remember to go to your appointments.
It's dangerous to avoid going to the clinic or hospital. Taking care of your health is important.
It's important to still go to your doctor and get the necessary treatments.
To stay healthy, it is important to take care of ourselves.
We need to talk to our doctors to make sure we do this correctly.
As a nurse, I have been inside all of the buildings during the peak of COVID and I can tell you that they are taking very careful precautions to keep us safe.
Make sure to take care of yourself.
Go outside.
I should call a friend.
You are not alone.
I agree.
What advice would you give me if I want to be a nurse or work in the health care industry?
I understand it was difficult for you to join this community.
I had a difficult time.
Do I understand correctly that this profession needs to recognize that people with disabilities can still do things?
I'm here to help you, even though I'm sitting.
We often doubt our own abilities due to our disability, like not being able to do something because we can't walk or lift.
How can I do something?
I do things differently.
I have different abilities and need to use different solutions to be innovative. No matter if I have a hearing impairment, vision impairment, or need to use crutches, sit, or can't lift, I can still find ways to be successful.
You may need help, but you can also do it yourself.
Remember, our perception of ourselves is more important than how others see us.
You can choose how you enter this field and create your own story.
You get to make your own decisions.
You made something beautiful!
In 10 years, where will you be?
I am working towards a master's in nursing education and I hope to earn a doctorate of nursing practice in the next few years.
I want to help our community.
It is extremely important to have healthcare workers who understand what it's like to have a disability, so they can treat it better.
I will treat and understand.
You made something beautiful!
Thank you, Andrea Dalzell, for joining us at Disability Unite.
I am a visionary, educator and inspiration to others.
I thank you for your contributions to our community. Your efforts have been an inspiration to me and many others.
We appreciate you joining us today and we're wishing you luck. We'll keep an eye on your progress.
I really appreciate you, Corey.
We appreciate you all.
You need to be careful.
You should say goodbye.
You are up next, Full Radius Dance!
I'm in Atlanta and I work with professional dancers, some of whom have physical disabilities, at Full Radius Dance.
I/We believe that including people in the performing arts, especially dance, can create energy, enthusiasm, and new ideas.
I perform in many places, including Atlanta, other states in the US, and other countries.
I need to do Re-Emerge, the first step of my Return.
I created Re-Emerge for the camera with music by Andrew Choe. It's Full Radius Dance's response to the self-quarantining we needed to do during the COVID-19 pandemic.
What should we do to come back?
I will choreograph the dance performance called Re-Emerge under the direction of Douglas Scott.
You can find Full Radius Dance at www.fullradiusdance.org. We are also on Twitter and Instagram @FullRadiusDance.
I'm Jeff Tweedy from Wilco and I'd like to introduce Gaelynn Lea, the next performer.
I met someone a few years ago at a festival in Montana.
Gaelynn is someone you feel close to right away, like a close friend or family member.
I have opened for Wilco.
I won a Tiny Desk Concert in 2016, and then I went on tour with my husband.
I do a show on YouTube every Sunday and I've been to 45 states and 9 countries.
I have a lot of energy to make the world a better place.
I have strong feelings for her.
I'm excited for you to see her perform.
Hi! I need to do some operations in order to help you.
I'm Justin Cooper and I'm part of the Chicago Disability Pride Parade Committee.
I'm proud to be part of this amazing virtual festival.
I'm thankful for Disability Unite for giving me a chance to talk to everyone.
During Disability Pride Month, I can show my disability pride by participating in parades and events.
Because of COVID, I need to change how I show my events.
We made a video here in Chicago with members of our committee. They talked about disability pride and the 30th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act.
At our meeting about the video process, Disability Unite members joined us.
I discussed my plans for the parade and they shared their plans for the virtual festival.
I thought of working together and discussed what it would mean for people with disabilities.
I worked with disability organizations across the United States.
I'm proud to be a person with a disability. I'm proud to stand in solidarity and support others during this pandemic.
We have been helping each other and providing resources to live our lives and be part of the community.
It's important for us to stay connected and show our love, fight for each other, and support each other right now.
Let's create disability pride parades and festivals to spread awareness and keep doing this for years.
I appreciate you giving me this time.
I want to thank Matt and Elizabeth Axel for contacting the Chicago Disability Pride Parade Committee and Disability Unite.
We look forward to working with you soon.
I really appreciate you giving me this opportunity.
I hope today's festival is great!
Let's celebrate disability pride!
I appreciate you.
Hi! You need to do certain things to be successful.
I'm Lachi.
Let's celebrate how awesome all of us are!
I, as part of the disability community, have intersectionality.
I'm a triple threat, meaning I can act, sing, and write.
I'm a beautiful black woman who is blind.
We are all different.
I am creative and I am full of love.
We are thankful for the regulation that has supported us for the past 30 years. We hope for the same support for the next 30 years.
I'm Laura Benanti and I'm proud to introduce Evan Ruggiero to you.
I'm from New Jersey and I'm proud of it!
When I was 5 years old, I began tapping and in my sophomore year at Montclair State University, I was told I had a very rare cancer.
I had to go through nine surgeries in six months and I had to make a hard decision to remove my leg.
Two days after getting his peg leg, he was able to start tapping again, 18 months after his surgery.
I think he is very brave and inspiring.
I'm so glad he can still perform for famous people like Ellen DeGeneres and the Bidens and even at the Oscars.
I'm amazed!
I am a Drama Desk nominee. I was nominated for the Chita Rivera Dance Award.
I think this person is great.
I find him to be very friendly and kind.
I appreciate you inviting me, and here I am.
Hello, I'm Thomas Ellenson. I'm excited to introduce my friend, Ryan Niemiller. He's hilarious and an inspiration to disabled actors and comedians like me.
I wrote my own material because I knew if I didn't, I wouldn't get hired.
I'm like Ryan and I don't think of myself as a disabled actor or comedian.
I have a disability, but it's only one part of who I am.
I don't limit my humor to one source.
I heard Ryan talk about how laughter helped him a lot.
People may be mean when you look or sound different from them.
If someone is teasing you, use humor to stop them.
I'm known as the Cripple Threat—I use humor to empower myself.
I experience joy when I laugh with people because it brings us together.
I'm excited to present Cripple Threat Ryan Niemiller from America's Got Talent!
I appreciate you all.
Hi! To do this task well, you must do some things: change words, delete information, add information, and be clear about what I mean.
I'm Victor Calise. I'm the Commissioner of the Mayor's Office for People With Disabilities.
Hi everyone, I'm excited to be here for the Disability Unite Festival!
We are thrilled to give you a wonderful program of music, dance, art, discussions, games, and more!
I want to thank the people from the Mayor's Office for People With Disabilities and Access For All who made this event happen.
We organized an amazing celebration, even though things are tough.
I'm feeling uncertain, as our country is going through some difficult times.
I saw our community come together and succeed.
Working together makes us stronger and helps us succeed.
Today is the 30th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act, a law that makes sure everyone has the same access to opportunities.
To honor Disabled in Action, an organization that fights for civil rights, we are celebrating their 50th anniversary this year.
We are thankful for the people at DIA who did whatever it took to get us the disability accommodations that we have today.
I support civil rights movements for my nation's communities of color and LGBTQ community. They help each other and make each other strong.
We are thankful for civil rights movements and should keep supporting them so the disability rights movement can stay strong.
We have made great progress in disability rights since the ADA was passed.
This July, let's celebrate our successes and keep advocating for what we believe in.
You can celebrate your community, individuality, and unique qualities at the Disability Unite Festival.
This platform helps create equity and inclusion for everyone.
Our community isn't determined by how far away we are from each other.
We each have community inside us.
I can show how I love and care for myself, my family, friends, and neighbors by how I speak, act, and advocate for them.
We are a powerful community.
I can help make change happen. We have made a lot of progress for people with disabilities and we will keep working until everyone in the country has the same access and opportunities.
I hope we can all get together for the festival next year.
I'm proud of Disability Pride Month.
We are excited to have you here!
We will feature artists of different styles, from beginners to professionals.
I need the ADA to do my job.
You may want to make art if you have a disability.
We need access in order to do this.
We can see many different artists and arts groups today because of that.
You need to do more than what the ADA requires.
Disability artistry encourages us to think of access as something we can practice, rather than something to follow regulations for.
Start now to create our future.
I'm Miranda Hoffner.
I help make sure people with cognitive disabilities can access the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts.
I'm excited to show you two pieces that we made for our ADA in the Arts series.
We have partnered with Heidi Latsky Dance at Lincoln Center for a long time.
We really admire her work.
This is SOLO FLIGHT ADA 30.
We are hearing from 15 artists, disabled and nondisabled, about how they are experiencing isolation.
You can have fun.
To understand this better, watch the ADA in the Arts Video Series at Lincoln Center.
I am working with Queens Theater and their Queens Theater for All Initiative.
I am reading "Death Bites," a story written by Makena Metz. It was created by a team of disabled artists.
We hope you like it!
I'm Rebecca Cokely and I lead the Disability Justice Initiative at the Center for American Progress.
I'm Jackson Santi from Chicago. I'm a poet and spoken word artist, and I'm just starting out.
When you listen to his poem, you'll see that he has a bright future.
I'm introducing you to Jackson Santi and his new song "Photosynthesis and Other Life Lessons".
I'm Ricky McKinnie from the Blind Boys of Alabama. Singing brings us closer together.
Welcome to Disability Unite Festival! This is an event for us to come together and celebrate everything about us.
I am celebrating the 30th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act by attending the Disability Unite Festival, which was created by the Disability Community Consortium Project Access for All and the New York City Mayor's Office for People With Disabilities.
I am part of Project Access for All, a community consortium consisting of many people and organizations.
We made this festival just for us.
I just heard from Victor Calise, New York City's Commissioner. He is the leader who made all this possible.
I have an awesome team.
I'm seeing New York City during the coronavirus pandemic. Jonathan Novick hosts weekly phone calls and we communicate really well.
We in the disability community got to know each other better and worked together.
You can see us helping each other during these tough times through the national network of Mayor's Offices for People With Disabilities.
This crisis has had a good result.
I have seen many disability groups join our community and work with us from all over the world.
This year is a special one, as it marks both the 30th anniversary of the ADA and 50th anniversary of Disabled in Action.
We are so proud to have Jean Ryan, the president of [organization], to open our first Disability Unite Festival today.
I need to end discrimination against people with disabilities. DIA, also known as Disabled in Action, is a civil rights organization that helps me fight for equality in American society.
Do you want to say something, Jean?
We appreciate your help.
I have been to a lot of meetings, sent a lot of emails, and been to some lawsuits and sit-ins in the past 50 years. Some of us have even been arrested.
I noticed that Commissioner Calise has an important role in our community.
I want to highlight that he was appointed to the MTA Board.
I have the experience and knowledge needed, and the community worked together to get me this appointment.
From now on, it's important for us to have a seat at the table and to develop our leadership skills so that people like Commissioner Calise can get appointed.
I feel happy when I hear about Disability Unite.
We have power because of the support of thousands of disabled people and allies.
I agree with Jean.
We can work together to make the changes we want.
We want you to enjoy the Disability Unite Festival and join us in making our communities a place where everyone is equal, has access, and is included.
I'm Chelsie Hill.
I started the Rollettes Wheelchair Dance Team.
I am part of an amazing team of women with disabilities, and they are proud of who they are.
We help women with disabilities live without limits through dancing.
We've been featured on NowThis, Huffington Post, BuzzFeed, Today Show, Good Morning America, Instagram and the Ellen Show.
Check out RollettesDance.com or follow us on social media for more information about us.
We are happy to join the Disability Unite Virtual Festival.
We are excited to welcome the Rollettes Dance Team.
I, Chelsie Hill, am performing We Can Together with Steph Aiello, Samantha Lopez, Conner Lundius, Edna Serrano, and Maria Rabaino.
I understand that gender equality affects everyone, not just women.
It is important for our social and economic wellbeing.
It's important to include people with disabilities in employment, not just for equality, but because it's good for business.
We need to create gender parity in the C-suite and close the gender pay gap now, not wait 100 or 257 years.
We must move forward and make sure everyone has equality, access, and inclusion.
We will spread the message of fairness for people with disabilities, racial minorities, and LGBTQ people.
Our actions have a combined effect.
I can help your organization make changes and get a good return by using the Female Quotient.
We are improving equality in the workplace and media by finding solutions, tracking our progress, and helping companies become more equal.
We give business leaders the resources they need to create equality. We also have The Modern Guide to Equality, a book to help people make a difference.
We want to work together with Disability Unite and the disability community.
