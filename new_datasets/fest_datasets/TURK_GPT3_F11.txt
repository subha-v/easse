Hello, everyone!
Happy 30th anniversary of the ADA!
Thanks for making this event so great.
Thank you to Corey and Elizabeth for having me here.
It's almost November, let's go out and vote!
Your choices and your voices matter now more than ever.
In November, it's important to use your voice, no matter what side you are on.
Know where to vote.
You can get an absentee ballot and maybe other options depending on the situation.
We are the biggest group of people, and we need to be treated fairly and have the same rights.
Remember to vote in November.
Do you notice me if I don't say anything?
This is a course to help you remember things.
Do we all have different cars?
Cars, trucks, bicycles, wheelchairs, motorized wheelchairs, canes and crutches.
Pay attention and be kind so we can all reach our destinations.
I said it before, this is a special time and place.
4 Wheel City wants to say thank you.
4 Wheel City.
Thank you for joining us tonight.
My name is Gha'il Rhodes Benjamin, I already said this.
I support disabled people.
We all share the same air.
Maya Angelou said we all have a lot in common.
Enjoy your summer!
Be careful.
We care about you.
Thanks for joining us!
See you soon.
Hello everyone, and welcome to the Disability Unite Festival.
My name is Gha'il Rhodes Benjamin.
I'm glad to be here with you tonight.
This is a moment we have been waiting for.
This moment is called "It Just Had to be Said".
This next segment is by artists, including me, that expresses our protest of 2020. We all want to redefine our identities.
These next few artists will give you the real story.
Now I can tell you a bit about me.
My name is Gha'il Rhodes Benjamin, I'm a performance spoken-word artist.
I wrote and performed this piece, it is called Global Libations.
We remember the people who are no longer here, who left behind families and friends. They were our heroes and sheroes.
Global Libations is here.
Zazel O'Garra is the founder and artistic director of ZCO Dance Project and she is very powerful.
She is very talented in the art world.
Nothing can stop her.
Zazel can do anything!
She is amazing.
The dancers she works with are amazing.
They move easily through space and time.
They never seem to stop.
They keep going even when it's hard.
Wendy Powell created a new piece called "We the People". You'll get to see what I mean.
Raise your hands up high.
Get ready!
Now, watch the ZCO Dance Project.
Go, ZCO!
Hello Andrea.
Welcome to the Disability Night platform.
Thank you for joining us today.
We are so honored to have you here.
People call you the seated nurse.
Can you tell us a bit about yourself and your disability?
Yes, I'm the nurse who stays seated.
I'm the first wheelchair user to graduate nursing school in NYC. I have transverse myelitis too.
When I was 5, I found out I have a disability, and when I was 12, I stopped walking.
Amazing!
You are amazing and very talented.
I have been friends with you for a long time.
You were also Miss Wheelchair New York.
Why did you decide to become a nurse?
I didn't always want to be a nurse.
A while ago, we talked about how important it was to be seen, right?
I couldn’t find nurses that looked like me, a woman with a disability, a woman of color.
I dreamed of becoming a doctor.
Before that, I wanted to be a lawyer.
I wanted to help someone else, so I could reach my goals.
Medical school teaches you how to treat diseases in the body.
I didn't want to treat someone like they were sick.
I wanted to help people, so nursing was perfect for me.
As a nurse in a wheelchair, do you think it helps to be able to relate to patients?
Yes, definitely.
You can give people a new perspective if you have a disability or are in a seated position.
Many people think disability is like a punishment.
When you become a nurse and have a disability, you show your patients that life is still possible outside of the hospital or clinic.
You are giving people hope and a new chance at life, even if their doctor or nurse doesn't have a disability.
It's a unique way of looking at things.
We like to come up with new ideas, so that's a great bonus.
We can think ahead and plan for the future.
Yes, exactly.
You helped with the COVID-19 crisis.
Can you tell us about that and your experiences?
COVID was really bad in New York, it felt like a tornado had come through.
Many people have died, many are still sick, and many are recovering. It is a difficult journey.
People say this is the new normal, right?
We don't want to be stuck inside.
We don't want our loved ones to get sick from COVID.
We with disabilities know what it is like to be excluded and scared to go out, so we understand this a little better.
We can adjust to this better than other people.
And now it's our turn to show that we understand.
Tell your stories.
Let's help each other get through this hard time.
Exactly.
What advice would you give to help us during this pandemic?
Many people have been alone, which is different from what we usually do.
What advice would you give to help people stay healthy?
Don't go to places with a lot of people right now.
Remember to wash your hands.
Remember to go to your appointments, OK?
Don't avoid clinics and hospitals, it is dangerous for your health.
Go to your doctor and get the treatments you need.
Let's stay healthy.
We need to talk to our doctors to do that.
As a nurse, I have seen the care taken to keep us safe when we go into medical settings.
Remember to take care of yourselves.
Go outside.
Call a friend for help.
You are not alone in this.
Yes, for sure.
What advice do you have for someone who wants to be a nurse or work in healthcare?
It was hard to be accepted in that community, wasn't it?
It was very hard work.
We need to remember that disability does not mean that someone is not able to do something.
I can be of help to you even though I am sitting down.
We sometimes put limits on ourselves, thinking that we can’t do something because it’s only for people without disabilities, or that we can’t lift something.
How can we make a change?
We do things in our own way.
No matter what your ability is, we can still find solutions and be creative.
Sometimes you need help, and sometimes you can do it alone.
Remember that other people's opinions do not define you.
You decide how to enter this field and what your story will be.
You decide what is right for you.
That's amazing!
Where do you think Andrea will be in 10 years?
I am studying for a master's in nursing education and hope to get a doctorate of nursing practice in a few years.
I want to do something to help our community.
It's important that people in healthcare understand the disability world, and can treat people with disabilities.
Treat and understand each other.
That's wonderful!
Thank you Andrea Dalzell for joining us at Disability Unite.
You are a big help to our community and I am inspired by you every day. Thank you.
Thank you for joining us, we wish you luck and will keep following you.
Thank you, Corey.
Thank you all.
Be safe.
Goodbye.
Now it is time for Full Radius Dance to perform.
Full Radius Dance is a professional dance group in Atlanta, with both disabled and non-disabled dancers.
The company shows that inclusion in the performing arts, like dancing, can bring power, passion and creativity.
Full Radius Dance performs a lot of shows in Atlanta, other US states, and around the world.
The company will show Re-Emerge, which is the first part of a three-part series called Return.
Full Radius Dance made a video called Re-Emerge to show how we are dealing with COVID-19. The music was made by Andrew Choe.
How will we start again?
The dancers have made a dance called Re-Emerge, and Douglas Scott helped them create it.

Hello, I am Jeff Tweedy from Wilco. I'm introducing Gaelynn Lea, the next performer.
We met a few years ago at a festival in Montana.
Gaelynn is someone you feel like you've known forever, like a friend or family.
She sang before Wilco.
In 2016, she won a Tiny Desk Concert and then she traveled with her husband.
45 states and 9 countries later, she has a YouTube show every Sunday.
She has lots of energy to make the world a better place.
I really love her.
I'm excited for you to watch her perform.
Hi everybody.
My name is Justin Cooper and I help with the Chicago Disability Pride Parade.
I am honored to be part of this amazing virtual festival.
Usually, during Disability Pride Month, we celebrate our disability pride with parades and events.
COVID changed how we can show our events, so we all had to find new ways to do it.
We made a video with members of our committee in Chicago. They shared their thoughts on the disability pride parade and the 30th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act.
Members of Disability Unite joined us during a meeting to talk about the video process.
We talked about our plans for the parade and their plans for the virtual festival.
We talked about how we could work together to help our disability communities.
I wanted to work with disability organizations across the US, not just Chicago and New York.
People with disabilities can take pride in being themselves, standing together, and helping each other during the pandemic.
We have always been there for each other, and we have shared resources to help us live our lives and be part of the community.
We should keep loving, fighting, and supporting each other during these times.
Let’s have disability pride parades and festivals to spread awareness and do this for many years.
Thank you for giving me this time.
Thank you Matt and Elizabeth Axel for talking to the Chicago Disability Pride Parade Committee and Disability Unite.
The committee is excited to work with you soon.
Thank you for giving me this chance.
I hope everyone has a great time today.
Let's have fun and be proud of our disabilities!
Thank you.
Hello everyone.
I'm Lachi.
We are here to celebrate our community and how amazing everyone is.
People with disabilities should all work together.
I am good at acting, singing, and writing plus more.
I'm a black, blind woman and I'm beautiful.
We are all different.
We can think of great ideas and we care about each other.
We are thankful for the law that has helped us for 30 years. We hope that it will help us for many more.
I'm Laura Benanti, and I'm honored to introduce you to Evan Ruggiero.
Evan is from New Jersey - we love where we come from!
He started tapping when he was 5 years old, and then when he was a student at Montclair State University, he found out he had a rare type of cancer.
He had 9 surgeries in 6 months and decided to amputate his leg.
18 months after surgery, and two days after getting his peg leg, he was back to dancing.
He is very brave and inspiring.
He has been able to perform for many famous people, like Ellen DeGeneres and the Bidens, even at the Oscars.
That's amazing.
He was nominated for awards like the Drama Desk and Chita Rivera Dance Award.
He is amazing.
He is very kind and that is important.
I'm glad to be here, and here he is.
Hi, I'm Thomas Ellenson. I'm so happy to introduce Ryan Niemiller. He is hilarious and he helps disabled actors and comics like me.
I wrote my own material so people would give me a chance and hire me.
But like Ryan, I am not just a disabled actor or comedian.
Disability is part of who I am.
My humor is not only from one place.
Ryan said that laughing saved him.
Kids can be mean if you don't look or sound like them.
Using humor is a good way to stop bullying.
Ryan is called the Cripple Threat-- the Power of Humor.
Ryan says that laughter helps people come together, and it brings happiness and joy to life, including my own.
I'm so happy to introduce Ryan Niemiller, who you might know from America's Got Talent and is also known as Cripple Threat.
Thank you all.
Hi everyone!
My name is Victor Calise and I work in the Mayor's Office for People With Disabilities.
Welcome to the first Disability Unite Festival.
We are excited to give you a great program of music, dance, art, talk, games, and more.
I want to thank the people from the Mayor's Office for People With Disabilities, the Disability Community Consortium Project, and Access For All for making this event possible.
We've put together a great party with help from people in our community, even though things are tough.
Our country is facing a lot of hard times.
I have seen our community succeed.
When we work together, we are stronger.
Today is the 30th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act, which says that all people should be treated equally and have equal chances to succeed.
We honor the 50th anniversary of Disabled in Action (DIA), a civil rights group started in New York City.
Let’s give thanks to the DIA leaders for fighting for us so that we have the disability rights we have now.
We honor all people in our nation, especially those in our communities of color and LGBTQ community, because we must work together to create a strong civil rights movement.
The disability rights movement is stronger because of other civil rights movements, and we should be thankful and keep supporting them.
Since ADA was passed, disability rights have improved a lot.
This July, we can celebrate, but we need to keep fighting for change.
The Disability Unite Festival is a time to celebrate our community and our differences.
This platform helps everyone be more equal and included.
We can be a community even when we are apart.
We are all part of a community.
It shows in how we talk, how we act, how we love, how we support ourselves, our families, our friends and our neighbors.
Together, we are really powerful.
We can make change, we have made progress in making sure everyone has the same rights, and we won't stop fighting until everyone is equal.
Have fun at the festival, and I hope to see you all in person next year.
Celebrate Disability Pride Month.
We will feature artists of all types, from new to experienced.
The ADA helps us do our work.
It suggests that disabled people might make art.
This helps us get the access we need.
That's why we can see different kinds of art today.
The ADA isn't enough.
Disability artistry helps us think of access not only as rules, but also as ways of doing things.
Our future starts now.
Hello, I am Miranda Hoffner.
I am the assistant director of accessibility at Lincoln Center.
I'm very happy to show you two pieces made for our ADA in the Arts series.
Our first partner is Heidi Latsky Dance, we've known them for a long time at Lincoln Center.
We respect her work a lot.
This is a special piece called SOLO FLIGHT ADA 30.
15 artists, disabled and nondisabled, tell us about their lives in isolation.
Have fun!
This part of the show is from Lincoln Center's ADA in the Arts Video Series.
We are working with Queens Theater, and their Queens Theater for All Initiative.
A group of disabled artists wrote, directed and performed a virtual reading of the play "Death Bites" written by Makena Metz.
We hope you like it.
Hello, I'm Rebecca Cokely, I work at the Disability Justice Initiative of the Center for American Progress.
Jackson Santi is a poet and spoken word artist from Chicago who is starting his career.
His poem will show you how bright his future is.
Jackson Santi is now performing his song, "Photosynthesis and Other Life Lessons".
Hi, I'm Ricky McKinnie from the Blind Boys of Alabama. We love to sing together.
Hi everyone, we are happy to welcome you to the first Disability Unite Festival. We are celebrating our community here!
The Disability Unite Festival was created by the Disability Community Consortium Project Access for All and the New York City Mayor's Office for People With Disabilities to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act.
Project Access for All is a group of people and organizations working together to make something happen.
This festival was created by our community and for our community.
Victor Calise, who just spoke, led this project and made it all possible.
The team he made is amazing.
Jonathan Novick hosts a weekly phone call to talk about how New York City is doing during the pandemic and it helps us stay connected.
We got to know each other better and worked together as a disability community.
Cities are helping each other through the Mayor's Offices for People With Disabilities during this tough time.
Good things have come from this crisis.
We are connecting with disability groups from around the world and growing together.
This year is the 30th anniversary of the ADA and the 50th anniversary of Disabled in Action.
We are so lucky to have Jean Ryan, the president of Disability Unite, here to do the virtual ribbon cutting and start the Festival.
Disabled in Action (DIA) is a group that works to stop discrimination against people with all kinds of disabilities. They help us get the same rights as everyone else in the USA.
Jean, do you want to say something?
Thank you.
We have had 50 years of meetings, emails, lawsuits, sit-ins, and some of us were arrested.
Matt, you mentioned what Commissioner Calise does for us.
I want to talk about his job on the Metropolitan Transit Authority Board, also known as the MTA.
Commissioner Calise has the skills and knowledge and people worked together to get this job.
We need to make sure we have a voice at the table, and we must choose strong leaders like Commissioner Calise to help us get more appointments.
I am very excited about Disability Unite.
DIA has the support of thousands of disabled people and allies, and that makes us powerful.
I agree, Jean.
If we all work together, we can make a difference.
We hope you have fun at the Disability Unite Festival, and join us to make our communities more equal and accessible for everyone, including people with disabilities.
Hello, I'm Chelsie Hill.

Gender equality is not only a women's issue.
It is important for us to do this.
Employing people with disabilities is not only fair, it's good for business and can help a company grow.
We can't wait a long time for gender equality. We need it now.
We can't wait to get equality, access and inclusion for everyone while we spread our message.
We will fight for fairness for people with disabilities, people of color, and LGBTQ people.
The Female Quotient helps companies make change and get the best results.
We are making sure that everyone is treated fairly in the workplace and media, and helping companies to be better.
We give business leaders the information and tools to help create equality and we created a guidebook to help make positive changes.
We are excited to work together with Disability Unite and the disability community.
