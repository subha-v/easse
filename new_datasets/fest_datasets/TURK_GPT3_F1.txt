We care about you.

Goodbye until we meet again.

I am Gha'il Benjamin.
I'm thrilled to be here with you tonight.
We have been eagerly awaiting this.
This moment is important and needs to be shared.
We are all creating art to protest the difficult events of 2020 and to create a new identity for ourselves.
These artists will be direct and honest with you.
I have an opportunity to share information about me.
My name is Gha'il Rhodes Benjamin. I'm a performance spoken-word artist.
This song is called Global Libations and I wrote and performed it.

Hello, Andrea!
Welcome to the Disability Night website!
Thank you for attending today.
We are pleased to have you here.
You are a nurse who sits while working.
Can you tell us a bit about yourself and your disability?
Yes, I am the nurse who is sitting down.
I am the first registered nurse in New York City with a physical disability. I have transverse myelitis, and I graduated from nursing school while using a wheelchair.
I was diagnosed with a condition at age 5 and stopped walking when I was 12.
I can't believe itThat's amazing!
You have special abilities.
We've been friends for a while.
You won Miss Wheelchair New York.
Why did you decide to become a nurse?
I didn't always want to be a nurse.
Do you remember when we talked about representation and what it means to us?
I didn't see nurses with disabilities like me-- not based on gender, race, or other characteristics.
I aspire to become a doctor.
I originally planned to become a lawyer.
I wanted to help someone else, so I could reach my goals.
Medical school teaches you how to treat diseases in the body.
I didn't want to treat someone badly.
I wanted to care for them, so nursing was the perfect choice.
As a nurse in a chair, did you find any advantages in being able to connect with patients?
Yes, definitely.
People with disabilities bring a unique perspective, even if seated.
People with disabilities are not doomed to failure; they can still achieve success.
Even if you have a disability, you can still work as a nurse and help people in and outside a hospital or clinic.
You're giving them a new chance at life, a hope that comes from someone who understands their disability.
It looks at things in a different way.
We're creative thinkers, so we get a reward for that.
We can plan ahead.
That's exactly right.
You helped during the COVID-19 crisis.
Can you share your thoughts and experiences on that topic?
COVID had a major impact on New York, like a tornado had passed through.
The number of people who have died, the number of people who are ill, and the number of people who are getting better will continue to change over time.
We are adapting to new ways of doing things.
I don't want this.
We don't want to stay confined.
We don't want our loved ones to get sick from COVID or experience its physical effects.
People with disabilities understand the difficulty of being excluded from activities, staying at home and feeling anxious when visiting hospitals or clinics.
We can adjust to it better than most people.
We understand what it's like to go through this.
Tell us about your experiences.
Support each other to make it through this challenging time.
Yes, exactly.
Stay safe and follow health guidelines during the pandemic.
Many people have been isolated due to the current situation, which is different from their usual routines.
Advice for maintaining a healthy lifestyle: Exercise regularly, eat a balanced diet, get enough sleep, and avoid unhealthy habits.
Limit attendance at large gatherings.
If you need to go outside, put on a face covering.
Wash your hands.
Remember to attend your appointments. Thank you!
It is not safe to avoid going to clinics or hospitals. Going to these places can help you stay healthy.
Go to your doctor regularly and take prescribed treatments.
We want to stay healthy.
To accomplish this, we should check with our doctors.
As a nurse with experience in many COVID-19 settings, I can assure you that all necessary precautions are being taken to keep us safe when we enter.
Take care of yourself.
Go outside.
Reach out to a pal.
You are not alone in this.
Yes, absolutely.
Advice for someone interested in a career in healthcare: Research the different roles that exist in the healthcare field; look into educational requirements for each role; and speak to professionals in the field to gain insight into their experiences.
It may have been difficult for you to gain acceptance in that group.
It was a difficult challenge.
Disability does not prevent someone from being able to do a job.
I can still help you even though I'm sitting down.
We should not put limits on ourselves or within our community. We can achieve anything, no matter our abilities.
What are the steps for doing something?
We have different ways of doing things.
We can accommodate people of all abilities by finding creative solutions.
Sometimes you need help, and sometimes you can do it alone.
Remember that your worth is not determined by how others see you.
You can choose how you want to start working in this field and decide what your story will be.
Only you can decide that.
That looks nice.
In 10 years from now, where will Andrea be?
I am pursuing a master's degree in nursing education and hope to earn a doctorate of nursing practice in the next few years.
I want to help our community.
Health care workers need to understand disability so they can provide better care for people with disabilities.
Treat with understanding.
That looks great.
Thank you, Andrea, for joining us at Disability Unite.
You are a visionary educator who inspires many people.
I thank you for helping our community progress. Your work inspires me and many others.
We appreciate you joining us today. We wish you success and we will keep up with your progress.
Thank you, Corey.
Thank you all.
Be safe.
Goodbye!

Hi, I'm Jeff Tweedy from Wilco. Gaelynn Lea is the next performer.
We met a few years ago at a festival in Montana.
Gaelynn made people feel like they had known her forever and were friends or family.
She performed before Wilco.
She won a special musical performance in 2016 and then went on tour with her husband.
She has performed in 45 states and 9 countries, and now she hosts a YouTube show every Sunday.
She has unlimited enthusiasm to improve the world.
I strongly care for her.
I'm looking forward to you watching her perform.
Hi everyone!
I'm Justin Cooper. I help plan the Chicago Disability Pride Parade.
We are honored to join this amazing virtual festival.
I'm grateful that Disability Unite gave me a chance to talk to you.
During Disability Pride Month, we celebrate disability pride with activities such as parades and events.
Due to COVID, we have had to adjust the way we present our events.
In Chicago, we created a video with members of our group sharing their thoughts about our disability pride parade and the 30th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act.
At a meeting about making videos, members of Disability Unite joined us.
We discussed our plans for the parade and the virtual festival today.
We discussed how we could work together to benefit people with disabilities.
Working with disability organizations across the US to help people with cognitive disabilities.
We people with disabilities embrace our identities and show unity and support during this pandemic.
We have always been there for each other, providing what we need to live our lives and be part of the community.
We should show love, stand up for each other, and offer help to each other during this period.
Let's join forces and organize disability pride parades and festivals to spread awareness and keep them going for the future.
I appreciate you giving me this time.
I am grateful to Matt and Elizabeth Axel for contacting the Chicago Disability Pride Parade Committee and Disability Unite.
We are excited to collaborate with you soon.
Thank you for giving me this opportunity.
I wish everyone a great time at the festival today.
Let's have fun and honor disabilities!
You're welcome.
Hey everyone!
Hi, I'm Lachi.
We are here to appreciate our community and how amazing all of us are.
People with disabilities are part of a diverse community that faces many overlapping issues.
I'm a talented performer who can act, sing, and write.
I am a beautiful woman who is black and blind.
We come from different backgrounds.
We make great things and care deeply.
We are thankful for being acknowledged by regulations for 30 years. Here's to the next 30 years!
I am Laura Benanti, and it is an honor to introduce Evan Ruggiero to you.
Evan is from New Jersey and proud of it!
At age 5, he began to tap dance. Later, when he was a student in his second year of college at Montclair State University, he was diagnosed with a rare type of cancer.
He had to have nine operations over six months and ultimately chose to have his leg amputated, which was a hard choice.
He got a peg leg two days after his surgery and was able to tap dance again 18 months later.
He is an amazing, inspiring person.
He is a very talented person and has been able to entertain people like Ellen DeGeneres, the Bidens, and during the Oscars.
That's amazing!
He was nominated for a special award given to outstanding dancers.
He's amazing.
He is very kind, which is very helpful.
I'm glad to be here, and I'd like to introduce you to him.
Hi everyone, I'm Thomas Ellenson. I'm so happy to introduce Ryan Niemiller, who is a very funny person and a great role model for disabled actors and comedians like me.
I wrote my own material so I could get a job.
I do not identify as a disabled actor or comedian, similar to Ryan.
I am more than my disability.
My humor is not limited to just one source.
Ryan said laughter helped him a lot when he was young.
Kids can be mean if someone is different. In my case, it's because of the way I talk.
If someone is making fun of you, using humor can be a helpful way to respond.
Ryan is known for using humor to cope with his disability.
Ryan has said that laughing together helps bring joy to everyone's life, including his own.
I'm excited to introduce Cripple Threat Ryan Niemiller, who you may know from America's Got Talent.
Thank you all.
Hi, everyone!
Hi, I'm Victor Calise. I'm the Commissioner of the Mayor's Office for People With Disabilities.
We're excited to have you join us for the first Disability Unite Festival!
We are thrilled to offer you a great selection of activities, including music, dance, art, conversation, gaming, and more.
Thank you to the members of the New York City Mayor's Office for People With Disabilities and the Disability Community Consortium Project, Access For All, for making this event possible.
We have worked with our partners in the community to create an amazing celebration in spite of the challenging times.
Our country is going through tough times.
Our community has been strong and successful in overcoming obstacles.
Working together makes us stronger, and together we can succeed.
This event celebrates 30 years since the Americans with Disabilities Act was passed. This law said that everyone should be treated equally and have the same opportunities.
We are celebrating the 50th anniversary of Disabled in Action (DIA), a civil rights organization from New York City.
We thank our DIA leaders for fighting for disability accommodations. They organized protests, held sit-ins, and even chained themselves to buses. Thanks to them, we have accessibility today.
We support civil rights movements led by people of color and LGBTQ people, which make us all stronger.
We owe thanks to civil rights movements that have made the disability rights movement stronger. Let's keep supporting them.
Since the Americans with Disabilities Act was passed and signed into law, there have been major improvements in the rights of people with disabilities in many areas of life.
We have many reasons to be joyful this month, but we need to keep fighting for our cause.
Celebrate our community, our individuality and what makes us special at the Disability Unite Festival.
This platform helps promote fairness and equal opportunities for all.
No matter where we are, distance does not change our sense of community.
We are all part of a community.
We express ourselves through our words, behaviors, relationships, and support of those around us.
Together, we are powerful.
We are working together to create change, we have achieved great success in advocating for disability rights and we will continue to fight for everyone's inclusion and equal access and opportunity.
Have fun at the festival and let's plan to meet up in person next year.
We celebrate Disability Pride Month!
We are happy to have you here!
We will showcase artists from many kinds of music, from beginners to more experienced performers.
The ADA is important for everything we do.
Disabled people can express themselves through art.
We are guaranteed the access we need to do this.
We see a lot of different artists and arts groups today because of this.
The Americans with Disabilities Act provides protections, but more is needed.
Disability artistry encourages us to view access not as a set of rules, but rather as a way of doing things.
Let's start building our future today.
Hello, I'm Miranda.
I help make Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts accessible for people with disabilities.
We are excited to present two pieces that we created for our ADA in the Arts series.
Heidi Latsky Dance is our long-time partner at Lincoln Center. They will be performing first.
We admire her work.
This piece is called SOLO FLIGHT ADA 30 and is meant for one person only.
This features 15 artists, both with and without disabilities, who are showing us how they are dealing with being alone.
Have a good time!
Watch this video from Lincoln Center's ADA in the Arts Series to learn more.
Queens Theater and the Queens Theater for All Initiative are working together.
This is a virtual performance of the book "Death Bites" by Makena Metz. It was created by a group of artists with disabilities.
We wish you pleasure from it.
Hi, I'm Rebecca Cokely. I'm the director of the Disability Justice Initiative at the Center for American Progress.
Jackson Santi is an up-and-coming poet and spoken word artist from Chicago.
He has a bright future ahead of him, which can be seen in his poem.
Jackson Santi is performing his song "Photosynthesis and Other Life Lessons".
to each other.Hello, I'm Ricky McKinnie from the Blind Boys of Alabama. We want to share that singing unites us all.
Welcome to the Disability Unite Festival! This event celebrates our community and gives us a chance to connect.
The Disability Unite Festival was started by two organizations--the Disability Community Consortium Project Access for All and the New York City Mayor's Office for People With Disabilities--to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act.
Project Access for All is a consortium of people and organizations that have come together to achieve a common goal.
Our community is coming together to celebrate.
Victor Calise, New York City's Commissioner, was essential to making this happen.
He assembled an amazing team.
Jonathan Novick hosts weekly phone calls to help people in New York City stay connected during the coronavirus pandemic.
We in the disability community got to know each other better and worked together as one.
We can see how Mayor's Offices for People With Disabilities from cities across the country are working together to support each other during these challenging times.
The result of this crisis is good.
Disability groups from many places have grown quickly and are working together.
Now, the ADA has been around for 30 years, and Disabled in Action has been around for 50 years.
We are honored to have Jean Ryan, the president of [organization], here with us for our virtual ribbon cutting to kick off the Disability Unite Festival.
Disabled in Action (DIA) is a civil rights group that works to end discrimination against people with disabilities. DIA works to remove the obstacles that keep us from having equal rights in the US.
Jean, do you want to say something?
Thank you for your time.
We have spent 50 years fighting for our cause, using various methods like meetings, emails, legal action and protests, leading to some of us getting arrested.
You said something about Commissioner Calise's part in our town.
I want to highlight his appointment to the MTA Board.
Commissioner Calise has the expertise and the community worked together to get him appointed.
It's important to have a presence at decision-making tables, and we need strong leaders like Commissioner Calise to advocate for us.
I'm thrilled to learn about Disability Unite.
DIA has the strength of many people - disabled and non-disabled - behind them.
I totally agree, Jean.
Working together, we can make a difference.
We invite you to have fun and be creative at the Disability Unite Festival. Let's work together to create communities that are equitable, accessible, and inclusive for everyone, including people with disabilities.

Gender equality is an issue for everyone.
It is important for society and the economy.
Including people with disabilities in employment is not just about equality. It can help a company to succeed.
We need to take action now to make sure all genders receive equal opportunities and pay. We can't wait any longer.
We must strive for equality, access, and inclusion for all while continuing to spread our message.
We will promote fairness and equality for people with disabilities, people of color, and LGBTQ people.
Together, we can make a difference.
The Female Quotient helps organizations make positive changes and get positive results.
We are working to make workplaces and media more equal and fair. We are doing this by finding solutions, keeping track of progress, and helping companies be more equitable.
We help business leaders create a more equal workplace by providing research, tools, and experiences. We also publish The Modern Guide to Equality, which gives practical advice on how to make positive changes.
We are excited to work with Disability Unite and disabled people together.
