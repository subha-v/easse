You can use absentee ballots, and there may be other choices too.
We are the biggest group, and it's time that we all have the same rights and choices.

Will you pay attention to me if I don't speak up?
This is a course to review the basics.
Do we all go in different cars?
Cars, trucks, bikes, wheelchairs, motorized wheelchairs, canes, and crutches.
Pay attention, and help us get where we are going.
This is a special time and place.

My name is Gha'il Rhodes Benjamin, I mentioned it before.
I support disabled people.
We all share the same air.
Maya Angelou said we are all connected.
Enjoy your summer.
Be careful.
We care about you.
Thanks for joining us.
We'll talk again soon.
Hello, everyone! Welcome to the Disability Unite Festival.
Hi, I'm Gha'il Rhodes Benjamin.
I'm glad to be here with you tonight.
We've all been waiting for this moment.
This moment is called "It Just Had to be Said".
The artists in this segment will show you how to protest 2020, our identity, fear, outrage, and defiance.
The next few artists will show you the truth.
Now I can tell you something about me.
My name is Gha'il Rhodes Benjamin, I am a performance spoken-word artist.
I wrote and performed this piece, it's called Global Libations.
We remember the heroes and sheroes who are no longer here. They left behind families who miss them.
Global Drinks.
Zazel O'Garra is a powerful leader of the ZCO Dance Project.
She has a lot of influence in the art world.
Nothing can stop her.
Nobody can stop Zazel.
She is really amazing.
Her dancers can do amazing things.
They travel easily through space and time.
They seem like they can't stop.
They never give up no matter what.
The new piece “We the People”, choreographed by Wendy Powell, shows everything I'm saying.
Raise your hands.
Be prepared.
ZCO Dance Project is here now.
Good luck, ZCO.
Hello, Andrea.
Welcome to the Disability Night platform.
Thank you for joining us today.
We are very happy you are here.
People call you the seated nurse.
Can you tell us a bit about yourself and your disability?
Yes, I am the nurse in a wheelchair.
I am the first nurse in NYC to use a wheelchair while graduating nursing school. I have transverse myelitis.
I found out I had a disability when I was 5, and I stopped walking when I was 12.
Amazing!
You are very special and talented.
We have been friends for a while.
You were also Miss Wheelchair New York.
Why did you decide to become a nurse?
I didn't always want to be a nurse.
We talked before about representation and what it means to us, right?
I couldn't find nurses that looked like me, a woman with a disability.
I wanted to be a doctor.
Before that, I wanted to be a lawyer.
I wanted to help other people, so I could reach my goals.
In medical school, you learn how diseases affect a person's body.
I didn't want to act like someone was sick.
I wanted to help people, so being a nurse was perfect.
As a nurse in a wheelchair, did you find any benefits to being able to relate to people in the patient setting?
Yes, definitely.
Your disability gives you a unique perspective that other people don't have.
Some people think disability is like a punishment, right?
Nursing with a disability shows patients that life continues outside the hospital or clinic.
You give them hope that doctors and nurses without disabilities can't.
It's a different way of looking at things.
We are creative, so there is a bonus.
We know how to plan for the future.
Yes, exactly.
You helped people during the COVID-19 crisis.
Can you tell us about that and your experiences?
COVID was very bad in New York, like a tornado.
Many people are still sick or recovering, and many have died. This is a long journey.
They say this is the new normal, right?
We don't want to stay inside.
We don't want our family to get sick from COVID.
We with disabilities know what it is like to be kept out, to be scared to go to the hospital or clinic, and we understand this better, right?
We can adjust to it better than other people.
We can now speak up and understand what this is like.
Tell us your stories.
We need to help each other to get through this.
Yes, exactly.
What advice do you have for us during this pandemic?
Many people have been alone, which is different from how they usually live.
What tips would you give to stay healthy?
Stay away from large groups of people right now.
Remember to wash your hands.
Remember to go to your appointments, OK?
Don't avoid clinics and hospitals, it can harm your health.
Go to your doctor and get the treatments you need.
We need to stay healthy.
We need to talk to our doctors to do that.
I'm a nurse and I've seen precautions taken to make sure people stay safe when they enter medical settings.
Remember to take care of yourself.
Go outside.
Talk to a friend.
You are not alone in this.
Yes!
What advice would you give to someone younger who wants to be a nurse or work in health care?
I know it was hard for you to be accepted and understood by the community.
It was a hard challenge.
It's important to remember that disability doesn't mean a person can't do something.
I can help you in many ways even though I'm sitting down.
Sometimes we think we can't do something because of our disability, but we can try!
Questions like how can you do something?
We do things in a special way.
We can all be creative to find solutions, no matter our abilities.
Sometimes you need help, and sometimes you can do it alone.
We don't have to let other people's opinions of us define us.
You decide how you want to get into this field and what your story will be.
Only you can decide that.
That's amazing.
What do you think Andrea will be doing in 10 years?
I am studying a master's in nursing education and I hope to become a doctor of nursing practice soon.
I want to help our community.
It's important to have healthcare workers that understand disabilities and can treat them.
We need to both treat and understand.
That's really nice.
Thank you, Andrea Dalzell, for joining us today at Disability Unite.
You're a great help to our community, so thank you. I'm inspired by you.
Thank you for joining us, we wish you luck and will follow you.
Thank you, Corey.
Thank you all.
Be safe.
Goodbye.

Hi, I'm Jeff Tweedy from Wilco. Gaelynn Lea is the next performer.
We met a few years ago at a Montana festival.
Gaelynn is very friendly, it feels like you've known her forever, like family.
She sang before Wilco.
In 2016, she won a Tiny Desk Concert, and then she and her husband traveled around.
She does a show on YouTube every Sunday, in 45 states and 9 countries.
She has lots of energy to make the world better.
I really love her.
I am excited to see her perform.
Hi everyone!
My name is Justin Cooper and I work on the Chicago Disability Pride Parade.
I'm honored to be part of this special online festival.
Usually we celebrate Disability Pride Month with parades and events around the country.
But because of COVID, we changed how we show our events.
In Chicago, we created a video where members of our committee talked about what the disability pride parade and the 30th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act means to them.
Disability Unite joined us for one of our meetings about the video process.
We talked about our parade plans and their festival plans.
We talked about how we could work together to help our disability communities.
I wanted to join forces with lots of organizations for people with disabilities, all over the US.
We are proud of being disabled, and we stand together in these hard times.
We have always helped each other and provided resources to live our lives and be part of the community.
We should keep loving, fighting, and supporting each other during this time.
Let's organize disability pride parades and festivals to create awareness and keep doing this in the future.
Thank you for giving me this moment.
I thank Matt and Elizabeth Axel for connecting with the Chicago Disability Pride Parade Committee and Disability Unite.
The committee looks forward to working with all of you soon.
Thank you for giving me this chance.
I hope the festival is great today.
Let's have fun and be proud of our disabilities.
Thanks!
Hello everyone.
My name is Lachi.
We are here to celebrate our community and how amazing we all are.
People with disabilities come from many different backgrounds.
I'm a triple threat - acting, singing, and writing.
I'm a black, blind woman and I'm beautiful.
We are all different.
We are creative and full of love.
We are thankful that we have been seen for 30 years. Let's keep it going for another 30 years.
My name is Laura Benanti, and I am proud to introduce Evan Ruggiero to you.
Evan is from New Jersey-- Jersey forever!
He began tapping at 5, then he was diagnosed with a rare cancer while in college.
He had nine surgeries in six months, and he chose to amputate his leg.
Two days after getting his peg leg, he was dancing again 18 months after surgery.
He is brave and inspiring.
He is amazing and is able to perform for people like Ellen DeGeneres, the Bidens, and at the Oscars.
That's amazing.
He's been nominated for the Drama Desk and Chita Rivera Dance awards.
He is amazing.
He is also very kind, which is important.
Thanks for inviting me, here he is.
Hi, I'm Thomas Ellenson. I'm really glad to introduce Ryan Niemiller. He is so funny and he helps disabled actors and comics like me.
I wrote my own material so people would hire me.
But like Ryan, I don't think of myself as a disabled actor or comedian.
My disability is only one part of me.
My humor comes from many places, not just one.
Ryan said that laughing helped him a lot.
Kids can be mean if you don't look like them or if you talk differently.
Using humor can help you if someone is teasing you.
Ryan is called the Cripple Threat-- using humor to make a difference.
Ryan said that laughing together brings us joy and happiness.
I am excited to introduce Cripple Threat Ryan Niemiller from America's Got Talent.
Thank you everyone!
Hi, everyone!
My name is Victor Calise, I'm the Commissioner for the Mayor's Office for People With Disabilities.
Welcome to the Disability Unite Festival.
We are excited to show you a great program with music, dancing, art, talking, gaming, and more.
I want to thank the NYC Mayor's Office for People With Disabilities and the Disability Community Consortium Project, Access For All, for helping make this happen.
We all worked together to make a special event during this tough time.
Our country is facing hard times, changes, and sadness.
I have seen our community work hard to get through this.
We work together and make each other stronger.
This event celebrates 30 years of the Americans with Disabilities Act, which made sure everyone has equal rights and access to opportunities.
We celebrate 50 years of Disabled in Action (DIA). They are a civil rights group from New York City.
We are thankful to the DIA leaders who fought for us and worked hard to get us the disability rights we have today.
We support communities of color and LGBTQ community, because when we stand together, we are stronger.
We are thankful for civil rights movements and must keep supporting them, which makes the disability rights movement stronger.
ADA helped us make a lot of progress with disability rights.
We should be happy this July, but we must keep fighting for our rights.
The Disability Unite Festival is the perfect time to celebrate ourselves, our community and everything that makes us special.
We want everyone to feel included and accepted.
Being far apart doesn’t change that we are a community.
We all have community inside us.
It affects how we talk, act, love, and fight for ourselves, our families, friends, and neighbors.
We are all stronger together.
We are making progress for disability rights, and we won’t stop until everyone has the same access and opportunity.
Have fun at the festival, and I hope to see you in person soon.
Let's celebrate Disability Pride Month.
We will show artists in different types of music and at different levels of their career.
The ADA helps us do our work.
It suggests that disabled people can make art.
It makes sure we can do that.
That's why we can enjoy so much art today.
The ADA is not enough.
Disability artistry shows us how access can be more than just rules, it can be part of how we do things.
This is our future starting now.
Hello, I'm Miranda Hoffner.
My job is to help make the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts accessible.
I'm happy to show you two pieces we made for our ADA in the Arts series.
Heidi Latsky Dance is first, we have worked together for a long time at Lincoln Center.
We appreciate her work a lot.
This piece is called SOLO FLIGHT ADA 30.
15 artists, disabled and not disabled, are sharing how they felt while being alone.
Have fun!
This video is from Lincoln Center's ADA in the Arts Series.
This is a project with Queens Theater, part of the Queens Theater for All Initiative.
"Death Bites" is a virtual reading written by Makena Metz, and it was made by disabled artists.
We hope you like it.
I'm Rebecca Cokely, the director of the Disability Justice Initiative at the Center for American Progress.
Jackson Santi is a poet and artist from Chicago who is starting his career.
When you hear his poem, you'll know he has a bright future.

Hi, I'm Ricky McKinnie, speaking for the Blind Boys of Alabama. We love singing together.
Welcome to the first Disability Unite Festival, it's all about us and for us.
The Disability Unite Festival is a project of the Disability Community Consortium Project Access for All and the New York City Mayor's Office for People With Disabilities to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act.
Project Access for All is a group of people and organizations that worked together to make this happen.
This festival is made by us, for us.
Victor Calise, New York City's Commissioner, just spoke and made this possible.
He has an amazing team.
New York City is going through the pandemic, and Jonathan Novick calls us every week to talk about it.
The disability community got to know each other better and worked together.
We can see how the Mayor's Offices for People With Disabilities all work together to help each other during hard times.
This crisis has a good result.
People with disabilities from all over are joining our community and working with us.
This year marks 30 years of the ADA and 50 years of Disabled in Action.
We are honored to have Jean Ryan, president of Disability Unite, here to open the first Disability Unite Festival.
DIA is an organization that helps people with disabilities get equal rights. It works to remove barriers which stop us from having the same rights as others.
Jean, do you want to say something?
Thanks.
We have done a lot in 50 years, like meeting, emailing, suing and sitting in, and some of us have even gotten arrested.
You talked about how great Commissioner Calise is for our community, Matt.
I want to recognize his appointment to the MTA Board.
People worked together to help Commissioner Calise get appointed because he has experience and knowledge.
We must keep having a voice and find strong leaders like Commissioner Calise to move us forward.
I'm excited about Disability Unite.
DIA has the help of many disabled people and their supporters, which gives us strength.
I agree with you, Jean.
We can make the changes we need if we work together.
We hope you have fun at the Disability Unite Festival. Let’s work together to make our communities equal, accessible and inclusive for everyone, including people with disabilities.
Hi, I'm Chelsie Hill.
I started the Rollettes Wheelchair Dance Team.
Our team is full of amazing women who don't let their disabilities stop them.
Our goal is to help women with disabilities to live freely and change how people think with dance.
We have been on NowThis, Huffington Post, BuzzFeed, Today Show, Good Morning America, Instagram and the Ellen Show.

We are thrilled to be part of Disability Unite's Virtual Festival.
Let's welcome the Rollettes Dance Team.

Gender equality is not just a women's issue.
It's very important for us.
Employing people with disabilities is not only fair, it is also good for business.
We can't wait a long time for gender equality and equal pay.
We need equal rights, access, and inclusion for everyone.
We will spread the message of fairness for people with disabilities, people of color and LGBTQ people.
The Female Quotient helps companies bring about change and get a Return On Equality.
We are helping companies be fair in the workplace and in the media by finding solutions, holding them accountable, and making sure they are equal.
We help business leaders learn how to create more fairness and publish a book with ideas for making change.
We look forward to working together with Disability Unite and the disability community.
