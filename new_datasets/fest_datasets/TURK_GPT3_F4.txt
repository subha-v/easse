It is time to go out and vote.
Your choices and voices always matter, but especially now.
It's important to vote in the upcoming election in November, no matter what your political beliefs are.
You can find your polling place by looking up your address on your state's election website.
The most important thing is that you make a plan for how you will vote.There are ways to vote even if you can't go to the polls in person. You can vote by mail or in some states you can vote early. You might also be able to vote by proxy, which means someone else can vote for you. The most important thing is that you make a plan for how you will vote.
We are the largest group on the planet, and it is time that we are equal in our voices and choices.
It is important to go out and vote in November.
This is asking if the person would be noticed if they didn't speak up and implies that they might not be noticed if they don't speak.

Hi!
This is a platform for people with disabilities like autism, aphasia, and ADHD.
Thank you for coming today.
We're glad to have you with us.
You are the nurse who works with patients who are seated.
I have difficulty understanding and processing information. I might have trouble following a conversation, or I might miss important details in what someone is saying to me. I might also have trouble remember things, or have trouble focusing on one thing at a time.
You're in a hospital.Yes, I am a nurse. You are in a hospital.
I'm a registered nurse in New York City. I'm also a wheelchair user. I have transverse myelitis.
I was diagnosed with a disability when I was five years old, and I stopped being able to walk when I was twelve.
That's amazingThat's great!
You're very smart and good at what you do.
We are friends.
You are also Miss Wheelchair New York.
I wanted to help people and make a difference in their lives.
I didn't always want to be a nurse.
We had spoken about how important it was to have people that looked like us in government. That understood our experiences, and could fight for us and our communities.I think it's still important to have that representation. People that look like us and understand our experiences can fight for us and our communities.
I want to see more nurses that look like me. I want to see more nurses that have disabilities.
I want to help people.
I wanted to be a lawyer before I became a writer.
I want to help people who are struggling like I did.
Medical school teaches you about diseases and how they affect the body.
I didn't want to treat someone as if they had an illness.
I wanted to help people, and nursing seemed like a good way to do that.
Being relatable to people in the patient setting can be beneficial because it can help build trust and make communication easier.
This means that the person agrees with what you said.
Being in a wheelchair or having any disability at all, you are bringing a perspective that somebody might not have, right?
Disability is often seen as a negative thing, but it doesn't have to be. There are lots of people with disabilities who live happy, fulfilling lives.
This person knows that there is a world outside of the hospital or clinic.
You are giving them a new lease on life by providing hope and support.
It's definitely a different perspective.
We're always coming up with new ideas and ways to do things, so there's an extra bonus for being on our team.
We are good at thinking ahead.
That's the whole point of this.This is designed to simplify things for people with cognitive disabilities like autism, aphasia, and ADHD.
You were on the front lines of the COVID-19 crisis.
I have autism, aphasia, and ADHD. I have difficulty communicating and processing information. I experience anxiety and sensory overload. I often feel isolated and misunderstood. I am working hard to advocate for myself and others with similar disabilities. I am passionate about creating inclusive environments and promoting understanding and acceptance.
- Yeah. It was really bad.- Yeah.Yeah, COVID in New York was really bad. It hit like a tornado came through.
There is no finish line for the number of people who have died, are sick, or are recovering from this illness.
They say that this is the new normal.
I don't want this to be normal.
We don't want to be restricted or have limited freedom.
We want to keep our loved ones healthy and free from the illness and symptoms caused by COVID-19.
We already know what it feels like to be excluded, to be afraid of going into hospitals or clinics, and to be worried about leaving our homes. So we understand this situation a little bit better than others.
This means that people with autism, aphasia, and ADHD can cope with change better than most people.
We have seen the movie, we know how this ends.We understand what you're going through and we know how this story ends.
We want to hear your stories about how you're experiencing the world during the pandemic.
We are all in this together and we need to help each other to get through it.
That is what we are doing.We are trying to make it easier for people with cognitive disabilities to access information and services.
The best advice is to stay home as much as possible, wash your hands often, and avoid close contact with people who are sick.
I know that a lot of people have been isolated recently, which is different from our normal routines.
There are some things that you can do to maintain a healthy lifestyle. First, you should eat healthy foods and exercise regularly. Second, you should avoid smoking and drinking alcohol. Third, you should get enough sleep and take care of your mental health.
It's best to stay away from big groups of people right now.
Wearing a mask will help protect you and others from the spread of the virus.
It's important to wash your hands to stay clean and healthy.
Make sure you don't miss any appointments.
It's important to keep up with your health and not avoid clinics and hospitals, because that can make your health worse.
It's important to keep up with your doctor's appointments and to take any medications prescribed to you.
We want to make sure that we're eating healthy foods and exercising regularly.
We need to see our physicians to do that.
They are taking measures to keep us healthy when we go into those buildings.
This means eating healthy foods, getting enough sleep, and staying active.It's important to take care of yourself by eating healthy foods, getting enough sleep, and staying active.
This means that you should go outside and explore your surroundings. This is a great way to get some exercise and fresh air.
If you want to talk to someone, you can call a friend. This is someone you know and like, and you can talk to them on the phone.
There are other people who are experiencing similar things. You are not alone in this.
If you want to be a nurse or work in the health care industry, here are some things you can do:1. Get a degree in nursing or a related field.2. Work in a hospital or other health care setting.3. Get experience caring for patients.4. Be compassionate and caring.
It wasn't easy for you to be understood and accepted into that community.
This was a difficult task.
This is still a profession that needs to understand that having a disability does not mean that a person is unable to do the job.
I may not be able to stand and do things like most people, but that doesn't mean I can't help out in other ways.I may be seated, but I can still help you. I can't do things like most people, but I can do other things.
We try to put the same biases on ourselves that other people put on us, like "oh, we can't do something because that's for someone who walks, or how would you be able to lift?"
How can you do something?
This means that we do not do things the same way as others. We have our own way of doing things.
We have to think about all different types of abilities when we're trying to be innovative.
If you need help, ask for it. If you can do it by yourself, then do it.
What this means is that we should not worry about what other people think of us. We should only worry about our own perception of ourselves.
You can choose how you want to enter this field, and decide what your story will be.
The only person who can decide that is you.
That is pretty.
In 10 years, Andrea will be an adult. She will be able to communicate more easily with others and will be able to understand more complex concepts. She will also be able to independently care for her basic needs.
I am studying to be a nurse educator so that I can teach other people to become nurses. I hope to get a doctorate in nursing practice within a few years.
I want to help our community.
It's very important that we have health care workers who understand what it's like to have a disability. This will help them provide better care to people with disabilities.
This sentence is saying that it is important to not only treat people with cognitive disabilities, but to also understand them.
That's pretty.
Thank you, it's my pleasure.
You are a visionary educator and an inspiration to many people.
Thank you for your contributions to our community. You are an inspiration to us all.
Thank you for watching. We hope you have a great day.
Thank you, Corey, for your help.
Thank you to everyone who participated.
This is a short and simple statement that means "be careful." It is a way of telling someone to be cautious or to take precautions.
This is goodbye.
Full Radius Dance will be performing next.

Hi, my name is Justin Cooper. I help plan the Chicago Disability Pride Parade.
It is an honor to be a part of this virtual festival.
I'm thankful for the opportunity to speak to you all. Disability Unite has given me a platform to share my thoughts and feelings. I appreciate the work they do in making sure that people with disabilities have a voice.
This year, we're still celebrating Disability Pride, but we're doing it a little differently. We're still having some events and parades, but we're also celebrating by staying connected virtually. So whether you're attending an event or staying home, we hope you'll join us in celebrating Disability Pride Month!
Due to the effects of COVID, we've all had to change our strategies on how we showcase our events.
We asked members of our committee to share their thoughts on what our disability pride parade and also the 30th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act means to them. Here in Chicago, we worked on a video with members of our committee.
We were discussing the video process and were joined by members of Disability Unite.
We talked about our plans for the parade and their plans for the virtual festival.
We talked about how we could work together to make things better for people with disabilities.
I'm committed to making sure that people with disabilities have the same opportunities as everyone else. That includes working with disability organizations to make sure that everyone can participate in society.
We are people with disabilities who are proud of who we are. We stand together and support each other during these difficult times.
We have been taking care of each other and providing resources so that we can all live our lives and be a part of the community.
We need to keep loving each other, fighting for each other, and supporting each other during these tough times.
We need to work together to create awareness of disabilities and make sure that we continue to do this for years to come. This can be done by putting together disability pride parades and disability festivals.
Thank you for listening.
I want to thank Matt and Elizabeth Axel for their support of the Chicago Disability Pride Parade Committee and Disability Unite.
We are excited to work with you in the future.
In conclusion, thank you for listening to me speak.
I hope you enjoy the festival today.
Let's all have a good time and celebrate our disabilities.
Thank you for your question. People with cognitive disabilities like autism, aphasia, and ADHD may have difficulty understanding complicated language. In order to make things easier for them, we recommend simplifying your language. For example, instead of saying "Thank you for your question," you could say "Thank you."
Hey there!
This is Lachi.
We're here to celebrate our community and how awesome each and every one of us are.
The disability community is made up of people with different types of disabilities who have different experiences.
I'm a triple threat because I can do all of those things and I'm also really smart. And I'm not just saying that because I have a high IQ. I'm saying it because I've been tested and I'm actually really smart.
I am black, blind, and I am a beautiful woman.
We are all different and have unique qualities.
We're full of love and we're creative.
We're grateful for the recognition we've gotten from regulation over the past 30 years, and here's to hoping we get the same for the next 30 years.
Hi, my name is Laura Benanti, and it is my honor to introduce Evan Ruggiero to you.
Evan is originally from New Jersey and still lives there.
He started tapping at age 5. When he was a sophomore at Montclair State University, he was diagnosed with a very rare form of cancer.
He had nine surgeries in six months and had to make a difficult decision to amputate his leg.
After a surgery 18 months ago, and only two days after receiving a peg leg, the person was tapping again.
He is one of the most brave and inspiring people I will ever know.
It's great that he's still performing for people like Ellen DeGeneres and the Bidens.
That's amazing.
He's been nominated for two awards.
He is a great person.
He's nice, and that's important.
Hi, everyone. Thanks for having me. The person I'm here to talk about is right here.
Hi, my name is Thomas Ellenson, and I'm happy to introduce Ryan Niemiller. He's a great comedian, and he's also a role model for me and other disabled actors and comics.
I copied his style and wrote my own material, knowing that if I didn't, people wouldn't give me that first chance to work.
I do not consider myself to be a disabled actor or comedian.
I have a disability, but it's just one part of my life. It doesn't define me.
My humor is not just limited to one source. It can come from many different places.
Ryan has said that laughter saved him early on.
When people look or act differently than most people, some kids can be mean. That's what happened to me because I have a speech disability.
When someone makes fun of you, using wit right away is a great tool.
Ryan is known as the Cripple Threat because he is funny.
Ryan has said that laughter is a powerful force that brings people together and makes life more joyful, including his own.
Hi everyone, it's me Ryan Niemiller. I'm known as the Cripple Threat because I have a disability, but that doesn't stop me from doing what I love. I'm a stand-up comedian, and I'm really good at it. I hope you enjoy my act.
This discussion is now complete. Thank you for your participation.
My name is ________ and I am running for the position of ________.Hello, everyone. My name is ________ and I am running for the position of ________. I would like to share my qualifications and why I believe I am the best candidate for the job. I have _____ years of experience in this field and have a proven track record of _____. I am passionate about this work and I know that I can make a difference in this role. Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to speaking with you further about this opportunity.
Hi, my name is Victor Calise and I work for the Mayor's Office for People With Disabilities.
This is a special event for people with disabilities. We have activities, music, and food. This is a place for everyone to come together and celebrate our diversity.
We are excited to present a program with music, dance, art, discussion, gaming, and more.
I'd like to start by thanking the members of the Mayor's Office for People With Disabilities and the Disability Community Consortium Project, Access For All, who have worked to make this event possible.
We've organized an incredible celebration during a difficult time, together with our community partners around the country.
Our country is going through a lot of changes and challenges, and some people are feeling sad about it.
Our community is strong and resilient. We have overcome difficult challenges in the past and we will continue to do so in the future.
We are stronger when we work together and we will be more successful if we help each other.
This event is to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act. This act was passed 30 years ago and it states that all people are equal and should have the same opportunities.
We are also celebrating the 50th anniversary of Disabled in Action (DIA), a civil rights organization that was founded in New York City.
Today, we are grateful to the leaders of the Disability Inclusion Act (DIA) who fought for our rights to have accommodations for our disabilities. Thank you to those who protest, sat in, and even chained themselves to buses to make the world a more inclusive place for people with disabilities.
We also recognize the struggles of our nation's communities of color and LGBTQ community. These groups support and help each other, and make each other strong.
The disability rights movement is stronger because of the civil rights movements that have happened. We are grateful for these movements and continue to support them.
This means that people with disabilities have more legal protections from discrimination in areas like employment, education, and access to public places.
We have a lot to celebrate in July, and we know that we need to keep fighting for what we believe in.
The Disability Unite Festival is a time and place to celebrate our community, celebrate our individuality, and celebrate the parts of ourselves that make us unique and amazing.
This is a platform that will help advance equity and inclusion for everyone.
A community is a group of people who interact with each other. They may live in the same area or they may not. What is important is that they have a shared interest or goal.
Our community is the people who make up our lives. It includes our family, friends, and neighbors. It's the people we see every day, and the people we don't know but who make up our world. We all have a community, and we all belong to one.
Being an ally is about using your privileges to support others who don't have the same advantages as you. This can be done in lots of different ways, like using your voice to speak up for those who can't, or using your platform to amplify the voices of others. It can also be about using your vote or your wallet to support the rights of others, or using your body to physically protect those who are vulnerable.
We are stronger than we think.
We are fighting for disability rights and we will continue until every person in this country has the same access and opportunity as anyone else.
Now enjoy the festival. I look forward to coming together in person next year.
Happy Pride Month to everyone, including those with disabilities!
We're glad to have you here.
We will be featuring artists from various genres who are at different stages in their careers.
The ADA is a law that helps protect people with disabilities.
Some people with disabilities might want to make art.
The ADA guarantees the access necessary for us to do so.
Different artists and arts groups exist because people have different preferences for what they enjoy seeing.
The Americans with Disabilities Act is a law that protects people with disabilities from discrimination. However, the ADA is not enough to protect people with disabilities from discrimination.
Disability artistry is about creating art that is accessible to people with cognitive disabilities. This means thinking about access not as a series of regulations, but as a series of practices. By creating art that is accessible to everyone, we can make the world a more inclusive place for everyone.
Our future begins now.
My name is Miranda Hoffner.
I help make sure that people with disabilities have equal access to Lincoln Center's performances and events.
I'm excited to share with you two pieces that we commissioned as part of our ADA in the Arts series.
Heidi Latsky Dance will be performing at Lincoln Center. This is a partner that we have worked with for many years.
We respect her work.
It is a metal sculpture that is 30 inches high and is in the shape of an airplane.This is a sculpture of an airplane that is 30 inches high. It is made of metal.
This exhibit includes 15 artists, both disabled and nondisabled, who are sharing their experience of isolation with us.
This means that you should have fun and not worry about anything else.
This video is part of Lincoln Center's ADA in the Arts Video Series. The series contains short videos about how Lincoln Center is making its performances and facilities accessible to people with disabilities.
This is a partnership between Queens Theater and a program called Queens Theater for All Initiative.
This is a virtual performance of "Death Bites" written by Makena Metz. The performance is written and directed by a team of disabled artists.
We hope you have a good time.

Welcome to the first-ever Disability Unite Festival! This is a festival about everything about us with us.
The Disability Unite Festival is a project that celebrates the Americans with Disabilities Act. It is put on by the Disability Community Consortium Project Access for All and the New York City Mayor's Office for People With Disabilities.
Their common goal is to create opportunities for people with cognitive disabilities like autism, aphasia, and ADHD.Project Access for All is a community consortium that helps people with cognitive disabilities like autism, aphasia, and ADHD.
This is a festival for our community, created by our community.
None of this could have happened without the leadership of New York City's Commissioner, Victor Calise.
He put together an amazing team.
They are seeing New York City through the coronavirus pandemic, and with weekly phone calls hosted by Jonathan Novick, we've had great communication.
We, as the disability community, found ourselves getting to know each other better and working together.
Each city in the national network of Mayor's Offices for People With Disabilities is helping the other during these difficult times.
This is a good thing that has come from this difficult time.
We have seen rapid growth of community and partnership from groups of people with disabilities from across the country and even around the world.
This is the 30th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the 50th anniversary of Disabled in Action.
We are very honored to have the president of Disability Unite, Jean Ryan, here to do the virtual ribbon cutting and start off the first Disability Unite Festival.
Disabled in Action (DIA) is a civil rights organization that works to end discrimination against people with all types of disabilities. DIA fights to remove the barriers that prevent disabled people from enjoying full equality in American society.
Jean, would you like to share your thoughts?
Thank you for your question. People with cognitive disabilities like autism, aphasia, and ADHD may have difficulty understanding or using complicated language. In order to make things easier for them, we recommend using simple, clear language. For example, instead of saying "Thank you for your question," you could say "Thank you for asking a question."
We have been fighting for our rights for 50 years. We have met many times, communicated through email, and sometimes taken legal or physical action to make our voices heard. Some of us have even been arrested.
What is Matt's opinion of Commissioner Calise's role in the community?
I would like to talk about his appointment to the Metropolitan Transit Authority Board, which is also called the MTA.
Commissioner Calise was appointed because he has the experience and know-how, and the community lobbied for him.
It is important to have a seat at the table, and we need to cultivate our leadership to have people who can push forward for appointments.
Disability Unite is a great community for people with disabilities.
The DIA community is strong because we have the support of thousands of disabled people and non-disabled allies. This gives us power.
I think you're right, Jean.
We can change the world if we work together.
We hope you enjoy the Disability Unite Festival and that you will join us in working to make our communities more inclusive for everyone, including people with disabilities.

Steph Aiello, Samantha Lopez, Conner Lundius, Edna Serrano, Maria Rabaino, and I are performing "We Can Together."
Gender equality is not just a female issue, it is an issue for everyone.
It's important for our society and economy.
It's beneficial for a company to include people with disabilities in employment because it's good business sense and it helps the company be successful.
Equality between genders is something that is slowly but surely happening, but it will take more time to completely close the gap between genders in terms of pay and high-ranking positions in companies.
We cannot wait for everyone to be equal before we push forward our message. We need to push forward our message now and work towards equality, access, and inclusion for all.
We will push forward the message of equity for people with disabilities, communities of color, and LGBTQ communities.
We can make a difference by working together.
The Female Quotient helps organizations improve their business outcomes by becoming more inclusive of women. This includes things like hiring more women, making sure women are included in important decision-making processes, and making sure women have an equal opportunity to advance within the company. When organizations make these changes, everyone benefits and the company sees a positive Return On Equality.
Our goal is to create a more equal workplace and society by providing tools and resources for change, holding people and organizations accountable, and helping companies become equality fit.
Our goal is to help business leaders promote equality in their workplaces and published The Modern Guide to Equality, a playbook for activating change.
We are excited to work with Disability Unite and the disability community to support each other.
